# Rename test helper

The original site included URLs of the form `/category/question-slug`, which was flattened to `/question-slug`.

This utility was used to verify that each original URL has a corresponding redirect.

At time of writing, it points to the test Federalist branch, but could be updated after deployment to production to point for faq.coronavirus.gov.
