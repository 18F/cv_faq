<h2> Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including refrigerated or frozen food? </h2>
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no 
evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always 
wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing 
your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching 
their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from 
food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.
