<h2> What is a novel coronavirus</h2>

A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), is not the same as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html"> coronaviruses that commonly circulate 
among humans,</a> and cause mild illness, like the common cold.

A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be 
evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.

<h2> Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?</h2>

The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

There are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Findex.html"> many types </a> of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
