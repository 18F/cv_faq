<h2>What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported (for example, by shelters, rescue groups, or as personal pets) from China? </h2>
Animals imported from China will need to meet <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/index.html" target="_blank">CDC</a> and <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-and-animal-product-import-information/live-animal-imports/import-live-animals" target="_blank">USDA</a> requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals including pets can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported from China should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic <i>before</i> bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently in China.
