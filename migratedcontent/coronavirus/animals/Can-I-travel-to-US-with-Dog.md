 <h2>Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs to the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak?</h2>

Please refer to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/index.html" target="_blank"> CDCâ€™s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States</a>. The current <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/rabies-vaccine.html" target="_blank">requirements for rabies vaccination</a> apply to dogs imported from China, a high-risk country for rabies.
