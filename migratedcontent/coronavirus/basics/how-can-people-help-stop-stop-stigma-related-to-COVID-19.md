<h2> How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19</h2>
People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. 
Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help 
stop stigma.
