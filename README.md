# faq.coronavirus.gov

A Coronavirus FAQ for the United States of America.

## Technology overview

This website is developed using the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), is deployed on [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/), search is provided by [Search.gov](https://search.gov/), and analytics are provided by the [Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/guides/dap/). This code uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site engine, and integrates [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for a web editor interface.

You may want to familiarize yourself with:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - The primary site engine that builds your code and content.
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter) - The top of each page/post includes keywords within `--` tags. This is meta data that helps Jekyll build the site, but you can also use it to pass custom variables.
- [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov).

## Getting acquainted

The [\_categories](_categories) folder contains the question groups, or categories, which are displayed on the site. Its `title` property is what is visible on the site.

In the [\_content](_content) folder you’ll find a folder which matches the `name` property of a category for each category. Inside that folder is a file representing each question in that category, which has a `category` property which also matches the category’s `name` property.

For more detailed coverage, see the [Content management guide](https://github.com/18F/cv_faq/wiki/Content-management-in-cv_faq).

### Adding an urgent alert
On the `index.html` you can add an urgent USWDS-style banner by changing the front matter. Turn the `banner.display` key to `true` to display the banner.

## How to edit

Content on this side is generated by our [Content workflow & governance guide](https://github.com/18F/cv_faq/wiki/Content-workflow-&-governance). To ensure we’re all using consistent voice and style, we also have [Content strategy guidance](https://github.com/18F/cv_faq/wiki/Content-strategy-guidance).

### Editing using the web interface

Access the editor interface by navigating to [faq.coronavirus.gov/admin](https://faq.coronavirus.gov/admin/) and logging in with your GitHub credentials. You will need commit access to this repository in order to access the interface.

#### Icons
Adding an top questions icon - if you need to add an additional icon add it to the `_assets/images/icons` directory and then add it as an option in Netlify CMS configuration in `admin/config:collections[0]files[0]fields-Image icon.options`.

And then if you'd like to use in a top question - add it in the `_data/homepage_promotion.yml` or update it through Netlify CMS.

### Editing by downloading and running the source code

The easiest way to get started locally, after the repository is forked, is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). After Docker is installed and running, run:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This will build and install all required dependencies, then compile the site, and finally start a development server which is accessible at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/). The server will recompile the site automatically as files change. Use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to shutdown the server.

Do not edit files in the `_site/` folder. These files are auto-generated, and any change you make in the folder will be overwritten.

#### Running without Docker

To run without Docker, you’ll need the version of Ruby that’s specified in [.ruby-version](.ruby-version). Then, to install dependencies:

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
npm install
```

Finally, to start the site, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your web browser to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to view your site. The server will recompile the site automatically as files change. Use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to shutdown the server.

## Automated testing

Tests are automatically run on commits and pull requests by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/cv_faq). They can be run manually:

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite includes:

- [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer), which looks for [some basic accessibility issues, for broken links, and more](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#whats-tested). We’ve also extended it [to check for well-formed links](htmlproofer/target_blank_checks.rb).
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/), [jest-puppeteer](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer), and [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) for custom integration tests. See what’s tested in the [test directory](test).
