Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and excretions (except sweat) may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions practices include hand hygiene, and the use of laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, eye protection or face shields, and masks, depending on the anticipated exposure.

In addition, Standard Precautions include protection of mucous membranes (eyes, nose, and mouth) for any procedures with the potential to generate infectious aerosols or droplets (e.g,. centrifuging, vortexing, pipetting, removing tube caps).
