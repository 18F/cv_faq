Ensure the outer package has been properly marked and labeled with the following:

1. Hazard labeled with UN Identification Number already on label – UN 3373
1. Biological Substance, Category B
1. Shipper’s name, address, and phone number
1. Receiver’s name, address, and phone number
1. Name and phone number of a responsible person is optional if it is on the airway bill

For additional information, refer to the following:

  - [When using cold pack](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/downloads/lab/UN3373-label-cold-pack.pdf) – Include the name and telephone number of the person who will be available during normal business hours who knows the content of the shipment (can be someone at CDC). Place the label on one side of the box and cover the label completely with clear tape (do not tape just the edges of the label).
