Personnel should use products with EPA-registered hospital disinfectants with label claims to be effective against other respiratory pathogens, such as seasonal influenza and other human coronaviruses. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for use â€“ dilution (i.e., concentration), contact time, and care in handling.
