For waste associated with testing clinical specimens from suspected COVID-19 PUIs, personnel should follow standard procedures associated with other respiratory pathogens, such as seasonal influenza and other human coronaviruses. Biohazardous waste containers should be leakproof and closed prior to removal from the laboratory for decontamination. If there is no autoclave onsite, then pack waste in accordance with institutional policy and procedures.
