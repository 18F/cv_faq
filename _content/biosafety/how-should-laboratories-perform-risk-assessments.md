Risk assessments and mitigation are dependent on the procedures to be performed, identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures, the competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures, the laboratory equipment and facility, and the resources available. Risk assessments should try to identify what could go wrong, and how the laboratory will mitigate those risks.
