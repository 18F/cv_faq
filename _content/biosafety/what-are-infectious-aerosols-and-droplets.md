**Aerosols and droplets*** containing particles that are <100 μm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles could be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment.

**Infectious aerosols** are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents.  They can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. These particles are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (<5 μm in diameter).

Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of _Aspergillus_ spp., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox).

**Droplets** traditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (>5 μm in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure.

Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include _Bordetella pertussis_, influenza viruses, adenovirus, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and _Neisseria meningitidis_.
