In clinical laboratories, personnel handling respiratory specimens, whole blood, serum, plasma, and urine specimens should use Standard Precautions at BSL-2. Conduct work using intact, full-length genomic RNA at BSL-2 (BMBL 6thed.â€“ prepublication). Personnel should perform site- and activity-specific risk assessments to determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs.
