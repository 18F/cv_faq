title: Will the government provide a second round of direct payments (checks) to people?
---

The U.S. government has already sent out 160 million Economic Impact Payments to Americans in need. A second round of payments would require Congress to pass a bill that provides additional funding. At this time, there is no legislation that has passed to authorize a second round of payments.
