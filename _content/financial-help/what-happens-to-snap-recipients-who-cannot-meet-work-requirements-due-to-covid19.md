title: What happens to SNAP recipients who canâ€™t meet the work requirements due to the coronavirus outbreak?
---

Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, signed into law by President Trump on March 18, 2020, USDA has suspended the [work requirements](https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/FFCRA-Impact-on-ABAWD-TimeLimit.pdf) (PDF, 359 KB) for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) throughout the national emergency. Therefore, the time limit does not apply, and these individuals can continue to receive SNAP benefits.
