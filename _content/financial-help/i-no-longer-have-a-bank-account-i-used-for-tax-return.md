title: I no longer have the bank account that I used for direct deposit on my tax return it. Can I change it using Get My Payment?

If the bank account is closed, the bank will reject the deposit and you will be issued your payment to the address we have on file for you. If our Get My Payment application indicates your payment has been processed, you cannot change your bank account information.
