title: Is the IRS sending prepaid debit cards?

Depending on your situation, you may receive your Economic Impact Payment on a prepaid debit card. The card will have your name on the front and will be issued by MetaBank®, N.A. The card will arrive in a plain envelope from “Money Network Cardholder Services.” Remember, you will NOT be asked to pay any money to activate your card.
