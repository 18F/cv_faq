title: I am not typically required to file a tax return. Can I still receive my payment?

If you are not normally required to file a tax return, you can use the [Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here) web portal to securely submit your information to the IRS. In order to speed payments, you should enter your bank account information and your payment will be directly deposited in your bank account.
