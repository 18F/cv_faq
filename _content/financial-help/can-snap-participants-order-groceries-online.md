The [SNAP online pilot](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot) is currently operational in Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, and Washington State. The authorized retailers working with all pilot states are Amazon and Walmart, while Wrights Market and ShopRite are working with Alabama and New York respectively. USDA previously announced [Arizona, California](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/04/08/arizona-and-california-added-innovative-snap-online-pilot-program), [Florida, Idaho](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/04/11/florida-and-idaho-added-innovative-snap-online-pilot-program), [North Carolina, the District of Columbia](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/04/17/dc-and-north-carolina-added-innovative-snap-online-pilot-program), and [West Virginia](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/04/18/west-virginia-added-innovative-snap-online-pilot-program) would also be joining. With these 16 states, more than half of all households receiving SNAP will have access to online purchasing.
