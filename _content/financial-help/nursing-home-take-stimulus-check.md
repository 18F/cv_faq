title: Did a nursing home or assisted living facility take your stimulus check?
---

In [May 2020](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/05/did-nursing-home-or-assisted-living-facility-take-your-stimulus-check), the FTC learned that some facilities were trying to take the stimulus payments intended for their residents on Medicaid. Why? They claimed that, because the person is on Medicaid, the facility gets to keep the stimulus payment. The fact is, those economic impact payments are a tax credit, and don’t count as “resources” for federal benefits programs, like Medicaid. If you or loved one experienced this, tell your [state attorney general’s office](https://www.naag.org/naag/attorneys-general/whos-my-ag.php) first, and then tell the FTC: [ftc.gov/complaint](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/).
