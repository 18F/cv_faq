title: If I receive Social Security benefits, do I need to file a tax return to receive
  my Economic Impact Payment?
---

The Department of the Treasury and the IRS announced that Social Security beneficiaries who are not typically required to file tax returns will not need to file an abbreviated tax return to receive an Economic Impact Payment. Instead, payments will be automatically deposited into their bank accounts. Recipients will receive these payments as a direct deposit or by paper check, just as they would normally receive their benefits.
