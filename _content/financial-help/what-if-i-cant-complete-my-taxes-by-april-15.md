[Treasury and IRS Delay Federal Tax Day from April 15 to July 15 Due to COVID-19 Outbreak](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm953)

Tax filings and payments for all federal income taxes (including self-employment tax) due on April 15, 2020, regardless of amount, will now be due on July 15, 2020. 

Taxpayers are not required to file any documentation to take advantage of this delay, and no interest or penalties will be assessed in connection with this extension.  This is an expansion of the relief previously announced on March 18, 2020.

This relief only applies to federal income tax (including tax on self-employment income) payments otherwise due April 15, 2020, not state tax payments or deposits or payments of any other type of federal tax.

Treasury and IRS will issue additional guidance as needed and continue working with Congress, on a bipartisan basis, on legislation to provide further relief to the American people.
