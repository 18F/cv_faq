title: What if I am unable to file my 2019 income tax return that was originally due on April 15, 2020, by July 15, 2020?

If you are an individual, you can request an automatic extension to file your Federal income tax return if you can’t file by the July 15 deadline. The easiest and fastest way to request a filing extension is to electronically file Form 4868 through your tax professional, tax software, or using the [Free File](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free). Businesses, including trusts, must file Form 7004 to request an automatic extension.

You must request the automatic extension by July 15, 2020. If you properly estimate your 2019 tax liability using the information available to you and file an extension form by July 15, 2020, your tax return will be due on October 15, 2020. To avoid interest and penalties when filing your tax return after July 15, 2020, pay the tax you estimate as due with your extension request. The extension only gives you additional time to file, it does not give you additional time to pay beyond July 15, 2020. If you do not pay your taxes by July 15, you will be subject to interest and penalties from July 16 until the date of payment.

U.S. citizens and permanent residents with a tax home in a foreign country who need an extension must file Form 2350 by July 15, 2020, if they can’t file their 2019 income tax return by the July 15 deadline. They should pay their taxes by July 15 to avoid interest and penalties.
