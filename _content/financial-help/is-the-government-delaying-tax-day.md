The Treasury Department and the IRS has delayed Tax Day from April 15 to July 15. This means you will not be required to file your federal income tax until July 15, 2020. You are not required to fill out any paperwork or notify the government to take advantage of this extra time. This delay **only** applies to **federal income tax**, not state taxes or other federal taxes. For more information, please view the [official IRS guidance (PDF)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-20-18.pdf).
