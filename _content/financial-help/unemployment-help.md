Check with your state to learn what help is available and to apply for unemployment assistance. States have varying programs that may help those who are facing unemployment situations. FEMA is also providing grants to states that request assistance with [payments for lost wages](https://www.fema.gov/disasters/coronavirus/governments/supplemental-payments-lost-wages-guidelines).
