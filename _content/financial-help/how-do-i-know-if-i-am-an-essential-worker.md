excerpt: "Essential workers"
---

Critical infrastructure industries, including many FDA-regulated industries such as food, drugs, and medical equipment, have a special responsibility in these times to continue operations. On March 19, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA) issued [guidance on defining essential workers](https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during-covid-19). This guidance offers an initial baseline for governments and industry to use when identifying key groups of employees during COVID-19 response. This guidance is not binding and serves as a starting point for local and state governments.
