title: Is there any help available for people who have federal student loans?
---

The CARES Act gives some flexibility to federal student loan borrowers. In some cases, the Act allows borrowers to temporarily stop making payments on their loans. This does not apply to all loan types.

[Research your options](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/05/coronavirus-and-your-student-loan-debt) and talk to your loan servicer. Understanding these options can help you make more informed decisions about [paying your bills and prioritizing your debts](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/04/managing-your-bills-during-covid-19).
