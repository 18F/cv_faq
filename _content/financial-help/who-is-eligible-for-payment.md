title: Who is eligible for the economic impact payment?
---

You are eligible for an Economic Impact Payment of $1,200 (or $2,400 if you filing jointly) if you are not a dependent of another taxpayer and have a work eligible Social Security number with adjusted gross income up to:
* $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns
* $112,500 for head of household filers and
* $75,000 for all other eligible individuals

Eligible retirees and recipients of Social Security retirement, survivor, or disability benefits (SSDI), Railroad Retirement benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and VA Compensation and Pension (C&P), who do not file a tax return, will receive a $1,200 payment automatically.

For eligible taxpayers who filed tax returns for 2019 or 2018, they receive the payments automatically.

People who have little or no income and didn’t file a tax return or don’t receive any of the federal benefits listed above are also eligible for an Economic Impact Payment. They need to register with the [Non-Filer tool](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here) on IRS.gov as soon as possible so they can receive a payment.
