No, the IRS is not going to call or email you asking to verify or provide your financial information so you can get an Economic Impact Payment. You should also watch for text messages, websites, and social media attempts to get your money or personal information.

Be on the lookout! Scammers may:

* Emphasize the words "stimulus check" or "stimulus payment." The official term is economic impact payment.
* Ask you to sign over your economic impact payment check to them.
* Ask by phone, email, text or social media for verification of personal and/or banking information saying that the information is needed to receive or speed up your economic impact payment.
* Suggest that you can get a tax refund or economic impact payment faster by working on your behalf. This scam could be conducted by social media or even in person.
* Mail you a bogus check, perhaps in an odd amount, then tell you to call a number or verify information online in order to cash it.

If you receive unsolicited emails, text messages or social media attempts to gather information that appear to be from either the IRS or an organization closely linked to the IRS, such as the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), forward it to [phishing@irs.gov](mailto:phishing@irs.gov).

Taxpayers are encouraged not to engage potential scammers online or on the phone. Learn more about reporting suspected scams by going to the [Report Phishing and Online Scams](https://www.irs.gov/privacy-disclosure/report-phishing) page on IRS.gov.

Official IRS information about the COVID-19 pandemic and economic impact payments can be found on the [Coronavirus Tax Relief](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus) page on IRS.gov. The page is updated quickly when new information is available.
