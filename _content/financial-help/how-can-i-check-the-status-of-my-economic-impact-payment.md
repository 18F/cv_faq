The IRS has a free web app called “Get My Payment” that you can use to check the status of your Economic Impact Payment. The app also allows you to securely send your banking information to the IRS, if you would prefer to receive your payment through direct deposit instead of waiting for a paper check. Use the app at [irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment).
