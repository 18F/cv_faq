title: Why am I receiving a debit card?

Depending on your financial situation, you may receive your Economic Impact Payment on a debit card instead of by paper check. These cards can be used to make purchases, withdraw cash from ATMs, and transfer funds to your personal bank account. For more information, visit [https://www.eipcard.com/](https://www.eipcard.com/).
