title: What do I do if someone calls, texts, or contacts me on social media claiming to be from the IRS?

The IRS will never contact you through an unsolicited call, text, or social media message. Do not share your personal information with possible scammers and report the scam to the [Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration](https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/coronavirus.shtml).
