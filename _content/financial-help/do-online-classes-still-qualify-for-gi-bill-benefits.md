title: My school changed all classes to online. Will I still qualify for my GI Bill benefits?
---

Yes. If you’re currently receiving GI Bill benefits, payments will continue automatically. You don’t have to do anything. We know that many schools have changed to online classes in response to COVID-19. You’ll continue to receive the same monthly housing allowance payments you received for resident training until December 21, 2020, or until your school resumes normal operations.
We’re working closely with schools to ensure enrollments are accurately certified and processed.
If you have specific questions, you can contact the Education Call Center toll-free at 888-442-4551, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
