title: Where can I get more information about economic impact payments?
---

The IRS will post all key information on [IRS.gov/coronavirus](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus) as soon as it becomes available.

The IRS has a reduced staff in many of its offices but remains committed to helping eligible individuals receive their payments expeditiously. Check for updated information on IRS.gov/coronavirus rather than calling IRS assistors who are helping process 2019 returns.
