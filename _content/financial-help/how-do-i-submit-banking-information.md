You can submit your information to the IRS through a [secure web portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here) on IRS.gov. You will need to provide your full name, date of birth, social security number, and bank account information to use this system. After you submit your information, you will receive your Economic Impact Payment through direct deposit.
