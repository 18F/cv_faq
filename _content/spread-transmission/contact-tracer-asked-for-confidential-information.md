title: A contact tracer asked for my Social Security Number or other confidential information. Should I share it?

Thereâ€™s no reason a legitimate contact tracer would need your Social Security, bank account, or credit card number. They also should not ask for a payment or your immigration status. Beware of anyone asking for this information who claims to be a contact tracer. Do not share such information or click on any links in emails or texts from them.
