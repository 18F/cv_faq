title: What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19?
---

There are several actions that individuals and communities can take to help reduce the chance that they, their families and friends, and their communities get COVID-19. In general, the more cases spreading in your community, the more likely it will spread to you or your family. Also, the more people an individual interacts with, and the longer each interaction lasts, the higher the risk of viral spread. Location can be a factor, too, with outdoor activities generally being less risky than indoor activities. 
 
Individuals can take the following community mitigation actions: 
- [Wear a mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) (with some exceptions) when in public settings or around others not living in the same household 
- Follow [healthy hygiene practices](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), such as frequent hand washing 
- Practice [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) 
- Stay home when sick 
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily 
 
Communities can take the following actions: 
- Promote behaviors that prevent spread 
- Maintain healthy environments 
- Ensure institutions in the community are practicing appropriate precautions 
- Prepare for when someone gets sick 
- Close businesses and schools, and limit other services
