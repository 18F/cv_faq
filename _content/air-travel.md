Testing before and after travel can reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. Testing does not eliminate all risk, but when paired with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like [wearing masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html) and [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html), it can make travel safer by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations.
Here’s what to know:

- Get tested 1-3 days before your flight.
- Get tested 3-5 days after travel AND stay home for 7 days after travel.
-- Even if you test negative, stay home for the full 7 days.
-- If you don’t get tested, it’s safest to stay home for 14 days after travel.
- Always follow [state and local](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html) recommendations or requirements related to travel.
- [Delay your travel](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/when-to-delay-travel.html) if you are waiting for test results.

Travelers with a known exposure to COVID-19 should [delay travel](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/when-to-delay-travel.html), [quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) themselves from other people for 14 days after their last known exposure, get [tested](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html#who-should-get-tested), and monitor their health.

Check if your airline requires any health information, testing, or other documents. Some destinations require testing before travel and/or after arrival. Information about testing requirements for your destination may be available from the Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health, or the [U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html).
