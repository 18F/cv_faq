title: Who is eligible for the economic impact payment?
---

You are eligible for an Economic Impact Payment of $600 (or $1,200 for married couples) if you are not a dependent of another taxpayer and you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien.

Eligible individuals will automatically receive an Economic Impact Payment of up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child.  Generally, if you have adjusted gross income for 2019 up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns and surviving spouses, you will receive the full amount of the second payment. For filers with income above those amounts, the payment amount is reduced.
