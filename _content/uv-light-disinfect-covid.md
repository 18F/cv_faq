title: Can the sun's ultraviolet (UV) light disinfect surfaces and shared objects?
---

We don’t know yet. Early scientific data suggest that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be inactivated by the sun’s UV light. However, the ability of the sun’s UV light to inactivate the virus on surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles) needs more research. Factors — such as cloudiness, latitude (distance from equator), time of day, and amount of time exposed to the sun’s UV light — will determine how effectively the virus is inactivated.

Remember to [clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/clean-disinfect/index.html) and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and [disinfectants](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19).
