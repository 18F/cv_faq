title: If I didn't get the full Economic Impact Payment, am I eligible to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit when I file my 2020 tax return?

If you didn’t get any payments or got less than the full amounts, you may qualify for the credit, even if you don’t normally file taxes. See [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit) for information.
