title: Am I at risk for serious complications from COVID-19 if I smoke cigarettes? 
---

Smoking cigarettes can leave you more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19. For example, smoking is known to cause lung disease and people with underlying lung problems may have increased risk for serious complications from COVID-19, a disease that primarily attacks the lungs. 

Smoking cigarettes can also cause inflammation and cell damage throughout the body, and can weaken your immune system, making it less able to fight off disease.

There’s never been a better time to quit smoking. If you need resources to help you quit smoking, the FDA’s [Every Try Counts](https://smokefree.gov/everytrycounts/) campaign has supportive tips and tools to help you get closer to quitting for good.
