Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.

We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:

- Take [steps](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html?) to protect yourself and others.
- **Call** your healthcare provider if you are [sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html) with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
- Follow CDC travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.
