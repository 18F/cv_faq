title: Are people with disabilities at higher risk?
---

Adults with disabilities are more likely to have an [underlying medical condition](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) that may put them at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 including, but not limited to, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancer, high blood pressure, and obesity. In addition, having a disability may make it harder to practice social distancing, [wear a mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html), and practice hand hygiene.

For more information, see [People with Disabilities](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-disabilities.html) and [People who May Need Extra Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations.html).
