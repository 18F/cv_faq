title: Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19?
---

Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps toâ€¯[protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html). See [Testing for Current Infection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) for more information.
