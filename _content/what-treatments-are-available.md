title: What treatments are available for COVID-19?
---

Currently there are no FDA-approved medicines specifically for COVID-19. However, the FDA has granted emergency use authorizations (EUA) for some medicines to be used for certain patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Emergency use authorizations are issued when there are no adequate, approved, and available options and timely access to medical products is important. The EUA may be revoked at any time. 

Medicine currently available because of an EUA include:

- Veklury (remdesivir)
- Olumiant (baricitinib)
- Bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody
- Casirivimib and imdevimab, monoclonal antibodies, sometimes called by the corporate name, Regeneron

These and all prescription medicines should be prescribed by your doctor based upon your specific needs. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19.
