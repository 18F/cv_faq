title: Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the
  spread of COVID-19?
---

CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage.
