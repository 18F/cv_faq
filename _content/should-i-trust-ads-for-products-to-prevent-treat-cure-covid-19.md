No. The FDA recently issued Emergency Use Authorizations for two COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, the FDA is working with other vaccine and drug manufacturers, developers, and researchers to help expedite the development and availability of medical products – such as additional vaccines, antibodies,  and medicines – to prevent or treat COVID-19. Some sellers may offer “treatments” in clinics or medical offices, including intravenous Vitamin C and D infusions, stem cell therapy, and immunity boosting shots. However, these are not FDA approved treatments. Any claims to the contrary are false. If you’re tempted to buy an unproven product or one with questionable claims, check with your doctor or other health care professional first.
