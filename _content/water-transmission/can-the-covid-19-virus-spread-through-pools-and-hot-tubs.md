title: Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through pools, hot tubs, spas, and water play areas?
---

There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas. Proper operation and maintenance (including disinfection with chlorine and bromine) of these facilities should inactivate the virus in the water.

While there is [ongoing community spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) of the virus that causes COVID-19, it is important for individuals as well as owners and operators of these facilities to take steps to ensure health and safety:

- Everyone should follow local and state guidance that may determine when and how recreational water facilities may operate.
- Individuals should continue to [protect themselves and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) at recreational water venues both in and out of the waterâ€”for example, by practicing social distancing and good hand hygiene.
- In addition to ensuring water safety and quality, owners and operators of community pools, hot tubs, spas, and water play areas should follow the [interim guidance for businesses and employers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html) for cleaning and disinfecting their community facilities.
