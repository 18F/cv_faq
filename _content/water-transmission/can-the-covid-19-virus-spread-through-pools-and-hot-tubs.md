title: Can the COVID-19 virus spread through pools, hot tubs or spas, and water playgrounds?
---

There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools, hot tubs or spas, or water playgrounds. Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools, hot tubs or spas, and water playgrounds should inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.

While there is [ongoing community spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) of COVID-19, there should be appropriate care taken both in and outside the pool, to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html). Owners and operators of community pools, hot tubs, or spas should follow the [interim guidance for businesses and employers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html) to plan and respond to COVID-19.
