## Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus? ## 

Wastewater treatment plant operations should ensure workers follow routine practices to prevent exposure to wastewater. These include using engineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/sanitation/workers_handlingwaste.html"> PPE</a> normally required for work tasks when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19â€“specific protections are recommended for employees involved in wastewater management operations, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.
