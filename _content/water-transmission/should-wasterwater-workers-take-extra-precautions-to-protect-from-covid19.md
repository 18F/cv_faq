title: Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from
  the COVID-19 virus?
---

Wastewater treatment plant operations should ensure workers follow routine practices to prevent exposure to wastewater.

No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for employees involved in wastewater management operations, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.
