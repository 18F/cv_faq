Wastewater treatment plant operations should ensure workers follow routine practices to prevent exposure to wastewater. These include using engineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/sanitation/workers_handlingwaste.html"> PPE</a> normally required for work tasks when handling untreated wastewater.
