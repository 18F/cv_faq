title: If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to
  wash my hands?

In most cases, it is safe to [wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html) with soap and tap water during a [Boil Water Advisory](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/drinking/drinking-water-advisories/boil-water-advisory.html). Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.
