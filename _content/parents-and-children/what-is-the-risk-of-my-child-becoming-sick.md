Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on CDCâ€™s current [Risk Assessment](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html#risk-assessment) page.
