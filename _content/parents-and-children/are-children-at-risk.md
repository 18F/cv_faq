title: What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?
---

Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed [multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html). Currently, information about this syndrome is limited. CDC is working with state and local health departments to learn more about MIS-C.
