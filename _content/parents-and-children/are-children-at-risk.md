Information about [COVID-19 in children](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html) is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that children with confirmed COVID-19 generally had mild symptoms. Person-to-person spread from or to children, as among adults, is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.  Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.

However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. People who have serious chronic medical conditions are believed to be at higher risk. Despite lower risk of serious illness among most children, children with COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with others who might be at higher risk, such as [older adults and adults with serious chronic medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html).
