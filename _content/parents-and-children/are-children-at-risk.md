Information about [COVID-19 in children](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#anchor_1584387482747) is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that healthy children generally have mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. 
[Children and adults with serious chronic medical conditions are believed to be at higher risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), as well as older adults. To protect those at higher risk, itâ€™s important that everyone practices [healthy hygiene behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html).
