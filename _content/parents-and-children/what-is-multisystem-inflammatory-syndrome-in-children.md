title: What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and who is at risk?
---

[Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html) is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the virus that causes [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care.

**Contact your childâ€™s doctor, nurse, or clinic right away** if your child is showing **[symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html) of MIS-C. Seek emergency care right away** if your child is showing any of these [emergency warning signs of MIS-C](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html) or other concerning signs.
