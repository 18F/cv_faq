You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.

* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
* Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.
* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
* If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, like tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles).
