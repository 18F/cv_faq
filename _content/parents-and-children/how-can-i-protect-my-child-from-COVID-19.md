You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.

* Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer
* Avoid people who are sick (coughing and sneezing)
* Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)
* Launder items including washable plush toys as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.
