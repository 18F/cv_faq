title: Can schools still serve meals while they are closed?
---

Yes. All states currently have a waiver in place that allows schools to serve meals through the [Summer Food Service Program (SFSP)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-food-service-program) or [Seamless Summer Option (SSO)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/seamless-summer-and-other-options-schools) during unexpected school closures, such as the current national emergency.
