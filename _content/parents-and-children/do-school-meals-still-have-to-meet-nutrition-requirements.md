title: Do school meals still have to meet the nutrition requirements?
---

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has provided a [nationwide waiver](https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/covid-19-meal-pattern-flexibility-waiver) for states to locally waive specific meal pattern requirements as needed to support access to nutritious meals when certain foods are not available due to the novel coronavirus. Local program operators must contact the state agency for approval to utilize this waiver, and requests should be targeted and justified based upon disruptions to the availability of food products resulting from unprecedented impacts of COVID-19.
