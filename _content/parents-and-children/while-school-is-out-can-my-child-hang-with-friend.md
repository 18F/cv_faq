title: While school's out, can my child hang out with their friends?

No. The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.

Make sure children practice [everyday preventive behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html), such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.
