title: Should children wear masks?
---

CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Masks should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
