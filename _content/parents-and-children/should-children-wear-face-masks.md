CDC recommends that people wear aÂ [cloth face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) their nose and mouth in the community setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception. Children younger than 2 years should not wear a cloth face covering because of concerns that they might suffocate.
