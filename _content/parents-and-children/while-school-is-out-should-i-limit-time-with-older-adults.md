title: While school's out, should I limit time with older adults, including relatives,
  and people with chronic medical conditions?

* [Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/people-at-higher-risk.html) are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.
	* If others in your home are at particularly high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people.
	* If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide childcare. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your childrenâ€™s contact with other people.
	* Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail.
