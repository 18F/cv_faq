title: What action is being taken to ensure children have food to eat while schools are closed?

States switch to their [Summer Food Service Program (SFSP)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-food-service-program) or [Seamless Summer Option (SSO)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/seamless-summer-and-other-options-schools) to serve meals to children when schools are closed. Through these summer meal programs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) allows sites to serve up to two free meals a day to children 18 and under.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, signed by President Trump on March 18, 2020, allows USDA the ability to issue nationwide waivers to further increase flexibilities. USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has issued [several nationwide waivers](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19/cn-waivers-flexibilities) to make it as easy as possible for children to receive these meals. As a result of these waivers, schools and other sponsors are creatively feeding kids by delivering meals on bus routes, allowing parents to pick up a weeks’ worth of meals at a time, and entering into public private partnerships like [USDA’s partnership](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/03/17/usda-announces-feeding-program-partnership-response-covid-19) with the Baylor Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, McLane Global, and PepsiCo, which is providing meals kids in rural areas. USDA FNS has a current list of [approved waivers](http://www.fns.usda.gov/coronavirus) and [meal sites near you](http://www.fns.usda.gov/meals4kids).

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act also provides states the option to provide EBT benefits to children who would normally be receiving free and reduced priced meals if schools were not closed due to COVID-19, known as Pandemic EBT or P-EBT. USDA has provided guidance to states on operating this program and continues to provide technical assistance to interested states. For logistical information about meal service, please contact your local state agency or school food authority.
