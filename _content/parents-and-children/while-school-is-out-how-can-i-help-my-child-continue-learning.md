* Stay in touch with your child’s school.
	* Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.
	* Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know.
* Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.
	* Have consistent bedtimes, and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday.
	* Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.
	* Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day.
* Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.
	* The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.
	* Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.
* Look for ways to make learning fun.
	* Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things.
	* Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks.
	* Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact.
	* Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.
	* Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events.
