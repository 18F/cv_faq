title: Can schools provide multiple meals at once?
---

Yes. Schools can provide up to two meals and/or snacks per day (excluding lunch and dinner in the same day). Under the [nationwide waivers](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19) currently in place, multiple days of meals can be picked up at one time.
