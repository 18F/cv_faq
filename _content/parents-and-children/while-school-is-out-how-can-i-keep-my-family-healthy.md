* **Watch your child for any signs of illness.**
	* If you see any sign of illness consistent with [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible. Follow CDC’s guidance on “[What to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html).”
* **Watch for signs of stress in your child.**
	* Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. For more information, see the “For Parents” section on CDC’s website, [Manage Anxiety and Stress](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html).
	* Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.
	* Go to CDC’s [Helping Children Cope with Emergencies](https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html) or [Talking with Children About COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/talking-with-children.html) for more information.
* **Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions.**
	* Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others.
	* Be a good role model—if you wash your hands often, they’re more likely to do the same.
	* Make [handwashing a family activity](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/handwashing-family.html).
* **Help your child stay active.**
	* Encourage your child to play outdoors—it’s great for physical and mental health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride.
	* Use indoor activity breaks (stretch breaks, dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused.
* **Help your child stay socially connected.**
	* Reach out to friends and family via phone or video chats.
	* Write cards or letters to family members they may not be able to visit.
	* Some schools and non-profits, such as the [Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning](https://casel.org/) and [The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence](http://ei.yale.edu/), have resources for social and emotional learning. Check to see if your school has tips and guidelines to help support social and emotional needs of your child.
