title: How can my family cope with the added stress?
---

Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past.

See information on ways to cope with stress (such as [visiting parks, trails, or open spaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/visitors.html)) and [making your family stronger](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html).
