title: How many shots of COVID-19 vaccine will be needed?
---

The currently authorized vaccines to prevent COVID-19 in the United States require 2 shots to get the most protection:

- [Pfizer-BioNTech](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart
- [Moderna](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html) doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart

You should **get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible**. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval.

Additional COVID-19 vaccines are in Phase 3 clinical trials. Learn more [about the different COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html).
