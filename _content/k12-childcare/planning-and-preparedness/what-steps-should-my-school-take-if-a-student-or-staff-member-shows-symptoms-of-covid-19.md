You should establish procedures to ensure students and staff who become sick at school or who arrive at school sick are sent home as soon as possible. Keep anyone sick separate from well students and staff until the [sick person can be sent home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html).
