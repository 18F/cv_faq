The most important thing you can do now is to prepare. Schools need to be ready if COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies:

* Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans.
* Develop information-sharing systems with partners.
* Teach and reinforce health hygiene practices.
* Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts.
* Monitor and plan for absenteeism.
* Assess group gatherings and events. Follow current guidance about non-critical gatherings and events.
* Require sick students and staff to stay home. Establish procedures for students and staff who are sick at school.
* Create and test communications plans for use with the school community.
* Review CDCâ€™s guidance for business and employers.
