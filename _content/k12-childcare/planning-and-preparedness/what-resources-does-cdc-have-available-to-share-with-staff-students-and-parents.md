Share resources with the school community to help them understand COVID-19 and steps they can take to protect themselves:

* CDC's [health communication resources](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/index.html)
* CDC information on [stigma and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/related-stigma.html)
* CDC information on [COVID-19 and children](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html)
* CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include [health promotion materials](http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/materials.html), information on [proper handwashing technique](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), and tips for families to help children develop good handwashing habits.
* Other health and education professional organizations may also have helpful resources your school can use or share, such as the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/When-to-Keep-Your-Child-Home-from-Child-Care.aspx)
* CDC's information on [helping children cope with emergencies](https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html)
