Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your communityâ€™s situation. Continue using the preparedness strategies implemented for no community transmission, and consider the following social distancing strategies:

* Cancel field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings.
* Cancel or modify classes where students are likely to be in very close contact.
* Increase the space between desks to at least 6 feet.
* Stagger arrival and/or dismissal times.
* Reduce congestion in the health office.
* Limit nonessential visitors.
* Limit bringing in students from other schools for special programs (e.g., music, robotics, academic clubs)
* Teach staff, students, and their families to maintain a safe distance (6 feet) from each other in the school.
