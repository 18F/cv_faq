Administrators of childcare programs and K-12 schools should take the following actions to plan and prepare for COVID-19:

* Review, update, and implement school emergency operation plans, particularly for infectious disease outbreaks.
* Emphasize actions for students and staff to take such as staying home when sick, appropriately covering coughs and sneezes, and washing hands often.
* Clean frequently touched surfaces.
* Monitor and plan for absenteeism.
  * Review the usual absenteeism patterns at your school among both students and staff.
  * Review attendance and sick leave policies. Encourage students and staff to stay home when sick. Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family members.
  * Alert local health officials about increases in absences, particularly those that appear due to respiratory illnesses.
* Monitor and plan for addressing fear and bullying related to COVID-19.
* Communicate early and repeatedly with parents directly what the policies and procedures will be to allow parents to assure proper guardianship and care of children.
