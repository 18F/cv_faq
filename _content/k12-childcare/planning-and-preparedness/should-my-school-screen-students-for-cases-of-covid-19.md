title: Should my school screen students for COVID-19?
---

Schools and childcare programs are **not expected** to screen children, students, or staff to identify cases of COVID-19. If a community (or more specifically, a school) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and follow up on next steps.
