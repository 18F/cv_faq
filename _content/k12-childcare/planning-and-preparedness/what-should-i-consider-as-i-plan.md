Administrators should always reinforce healthy practices among their staff and students, as well as prepare for a potential case of COVID-19, regardless of the current level of community transmission.

As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and actions for your school or program. Together, you will need to consider your local community situation—whether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial).

CDC has created overall guidance, as well as guidance tailored for transmission level in your area to help childcare programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent COVID-19 and react quickly when a case is identified.  The guidance includes information about the following:

* How to prepare if you have no community spread of COVID-19.
* How to prepare if you have minimal to moderate community spread in your community.
* How to prepare if you have substantial community spread in your community.
* What to do if a person with COVID-19 has entered your school.
