* The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit social interactions as much as possible. Parents should minimize play dates, and if held, parents should keep the groups small. Advise older children to hang out in a small group and to meet up outside rather than inside. Itâ€™s easier to keep and maintain space between others in outdoor settings, like parks.

* If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put 
distance between themselves and others (i.e. social distancing). Make sure children practice [everyday preventative behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html), 
such as cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Remember, if children meet outside of school in bigger 
groups, it can put everyone at risk.

  * This includes spring break and other group travel. Parents should help their older children revise spring break plans that included non-essential travel to crowded areas.

* Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may show only mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including 
[older adults and people who have serious chronic medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html).
