* The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit contact as much as possible. If you have play dates, keep the groups small. Encourage older children to hang out in a small group and to meet outside rather than inside. Itâ€™s easier to keep and maintain space between others in outdoor settings, like parks.
* If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put distance between themselves and others (social distancing). Make sure children practice [everyday preventive behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html), such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk.
	* Revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.
* Information about [COVID-19 in children](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#anchor_1584387482747) is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may only have mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including [older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/people-at-higher-risk.html).
