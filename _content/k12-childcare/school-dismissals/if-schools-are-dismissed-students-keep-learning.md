Yes, consider implementing e-learning plans, including digital and distance learning options as feasible and appropriate. Determine, in consultation with school district officials or other relevant state or local partners:

* If a waiver is needed for state requirements of a minimum number of in-person instructional hours or school days (seat time) as a condition for funding.
* How to convert face-to-face lessons into online lessons and how to train teachers to do so.
* How to triage technical issues if faced with limited IT support and staff.
* How to encourage appropriate adult supervision while children are using distance learning approaches.
* How to deal with the potential lack of studentsâ€™ access to computers and the internet at home.
