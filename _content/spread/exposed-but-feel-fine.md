title: I was around someone who has COVID-19, but I feel fine. Why should I stay at home?

People with COVID-19 can still spread the virus even if they donâ€™t have any symptoms. If you were around someone who had COVID-19, it is critical that you stay home and away from others for 14 days from the last day that you were around that person. Staying home and away from others at all times helps your health department in the fight against COVID-19 and helps protect you, your family, and your community.
