title: Can I get COVID-19 from a food worker handling my food?
---

Currently, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person in some communities in the U.S. The CDC recommends that if you are sick, stay home until you are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow [safe food handling procedures](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/safe-food-handling), such as washing hands and surfaces often.
