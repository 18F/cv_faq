title: Should food workers who are ill stay home?
---

CDC recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4° F / 37.8° C) or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants). Employees should notify their supervisor and stay home if they are sick. We recommend that businesses review [CDC's interim guidance for businesses and employers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) for planning and responding to coronavirus disease. Also see the FDA's [Retail Food Protection: Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook](https://www.fda.gov/food/retail-food-industryregulatory-assistance-training/retail-food-protection-employee-health-and-personal-hygiene-handbook).
