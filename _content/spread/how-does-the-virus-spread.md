excerpt: How it spreads
---

This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in [some affected geographic areas](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html). Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
