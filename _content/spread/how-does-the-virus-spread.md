This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, 
but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a 
continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) 
in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Ftransmission.html"> some affected geographic areas</a>. 
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they 
became infected.
