Yes. On December 11, 2020 the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine). 

On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the [Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/moderna-covid-19-vaccine).

Additionally, the FDA is working with other vaccine developers, researchers, and manufacturers to help expedite the development and availability of medical products such as additional vaccines and antibodies, and drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19.
