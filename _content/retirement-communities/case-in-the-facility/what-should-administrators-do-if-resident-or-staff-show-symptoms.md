title: What should administrators do if a resident or staff shows symptoms of COVID-19?
---

Ask residents to actively monitor (at least daily) for [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html), including fever and respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, new or change in cough). Administrators should work with local health authorities to establish procedures for those who become sick. Sick residents should avoid contact with individuals who are healthy. If you think someone may have COVID-19, ask them to self-isolate and you should contact local health officials.
