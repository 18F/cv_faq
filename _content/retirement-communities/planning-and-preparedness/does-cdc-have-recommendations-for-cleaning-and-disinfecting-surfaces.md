Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, countertops) with cleaners that you typically use. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. [Practice strict infection control procedures if there is a case in your facility.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/index.html)
