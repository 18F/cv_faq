[Administrators should take the following actions to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in their community or facility:](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/retirement/guidance-retirement-response.html)

- Promote social distancing
  - Cancel public or group activities and events
  - Inform workers and volunteers to avoid close contact with residents
  - When possible, limit visitors and volunteers to essential persons
  - Advise residents to stay home and avoid public places
  - Alter schedules to reduce mixing (e.g., stagger meal, activity, arrival/departure times)
- Support residents in preparing
  - Establish the ‘buddy’ system to ensure residents stay connected.
  - Encourage residents to have extra medications and supplies.
  - Identify residents with unique needs and work with them to tailor these strategies.
  - Find ways to support residents in [managing stress and anxiety](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html).
  - Inform residents using print materials and high-visibility posters
- Encourage everyone to take [everyday preventive actions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html) to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses.
  - Cover coughs and sneezes
  - Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces
  - Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
  - Ensure hand hygiene supplies (e.g., hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol) are readily available in all buildings.
- Monitor for cases and take action when someone is sick.
  - Screen workers and when possible volunteers
  - Ask residents to self-monitor for symptoms
  - Review the usual absenteeism patterns at your facility among staff, so you can identify if the rate of absenteeism increases.
  - Implement flexible sick-leave policies and actively encourage sick employees to stay home
  - Coordinate with local health facilities if you suspect a resident or staff member may have COVID-19
