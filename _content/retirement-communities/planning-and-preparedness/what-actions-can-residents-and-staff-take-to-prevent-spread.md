Encourage residents and staff to take [everyday preventive actions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html) to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. Actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; [cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html); and washing hands often with soap and water.
