Social distancingÂ means remaining out of places where people meet or gather, avoiding local public transportation (e.g., bus, subway, taxi, rideshare), and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others.

You practice social distancing when you stay out of crowded places and avoid group gatherings.
