title: Why are the death counts for the Cases on the U.S. webpage different from the
  Provisional Death Counts on the COVID-19 webpage?
---

The COVID-19 death count shown on the [Cases in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) web page includes deaths reported daily by state, local, and territorial health departments. This count reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting from health departments.

In contrast, [provisional COVID-19 death counts](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/COVID19/index.htm) from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated Monday through Friday with information collected from death certificates. These data represent the most accurate death counts. However, because it can take several weeks for death certificates to be submitted and processed, there is on average a delay of 1â€“2 weeks before they are reported. Therefore, the provisional death counts may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods. Death counts from earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received. Provisional COVID-19 death counts may therefore differ from those on other published sources, such as media reports or the [Cases in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) web page.
