excerpt: About COVID-19

A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019
(also known as COVID-19) is not the same as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html">coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans</a> and cause mild illness like the common cold.

A diagnosis of coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be
evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnoses.
