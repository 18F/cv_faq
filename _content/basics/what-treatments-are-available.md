excerpt: About COVID-19

People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.

Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has [more information for health care providers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html) about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.
