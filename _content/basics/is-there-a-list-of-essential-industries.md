Yes. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has a list of essential industries available online.

Those industries include:

**Healthcare/Public Health** (i.e. Hospitals and Doctors)
**Law Enforcement, Public Safety and First Responders** (i.e. Police and Emergency Management Services)
**Food and Agriculture** (i.e. Farmers and food manufacturers)
**Energy** (i.e. Natural Gas and Nuclear facilities)
Water and Waste water (i.e. Water Department)
**Transportation and Logistics** (i.e. Trucking and shipping)  
**Public Works and Infrastructure** (i.e. Safety inspectors for public facilities including dams, bridges, etc.)
**Communications and Information Technology** (i.e. maintainers of communications infrastructure, such as wireless, internet and cable providers)
**Community and Local Government** (i.e. federal, state, local, tribal and territorial employees who support Mission Essential Functions)
**Critical Manufacturing** (i.e. metals, PPE, supply chain minerals and employees that support other essential services)
**Hazardous Materials** (i.e. healthcare waste and nuclear facilities)
**Financial Services** (i.e. banks)
**Chemical** (i.e. workers supporting the chemical and industrial gas supply chains)
**Defense Industrial** (i.e. essential services required to meet national security commitments to the federal government and U.S. Military)
**Commercial Facilities** (i.e. workers who support the supply chain of building materials)
**Residential/Shelter Facilities** (i.e.  workers in dependent care services)
**Hygiene Products and Services** (i.e. laundromats, personal and household goods repair and maintenance)

While this guidance is not a federal mandate, and final decisions remain at the state and local levels, we firmly believe it can serve as a baseline for a common national approach in prioritizing essential services and workers.
