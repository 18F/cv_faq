title: Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through flood water?
---

There is [no evidence that COVID-19 can spread to people through water, including floodwater](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/water.html#Food-and-Water).  

Sometimes floodwater can mix with [wastewater](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/sanitation-wastewater-workers.html). CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces from an infected person. Stay out of floodwater to [avoid hazards and illnesses](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/floods/floodsafety.html) from contaminants that are not associated with COVID-19. To learn more about COVID-19 and wastewater, see question, [“Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems?”](https://faq.coronavirus.gov/can-the-covid-19-virus-spread-through-sewerage-systems/)
