title: Can parents pick up meals for their kids without their children present?

Yes. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, signed on March 18, 2020, allows USDA the ability to issue nationwide waivers to further increase flexibilities, allowing parents and guardians to pick up meals and bring them home for their children.
