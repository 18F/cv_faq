title: Can parents pick up meals for their kids without their children present?

Yes. Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) issued a [nationwide waiver](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19) allowing parents and guardians to pick up meals and bring them home for their children.
