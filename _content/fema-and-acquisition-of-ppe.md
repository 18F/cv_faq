title: What is FEMA’s role in the acquisition and delivery of Personal Protective
  Equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies?
---

FEMA works with HHS and federal partners to coordinate the distribution of medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE). The supplies originate from multiple sources including [Project Airbridge](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/04/08/fema-covid-19-supply-chain-task-force-supply-chain-stabilization), the Strategic National Stockpile, private industry donations, federal interagency allocation and vendor procurements. These shipments are being sent with prioritization given to the areas with the most critical need for those supplies based on [HHS and CDC data](https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-national-resource-prioritization-cell).

FEMA is not seizing or taking PPE or other medical supplies from state or local governments, hospitals, or anyone lawfully engaged in acquiring or distributing PPE. Learn more from FEMA’s [rumor control page](https://www.fema.gov/coronavirus/rumor-control).
