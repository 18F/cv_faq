title: Why would a vaccine be needed if we can do other things, like social distancing and wearing masks, to prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading?

Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and staying at least 6 feet away from others, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDCâ€™s recommendations [to protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) will offer the best protection from COVID-19.
