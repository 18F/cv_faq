title: Is at-home specimen collection or testing available?
---

Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or perform the test at home.

You and your healthcare provider might consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or if you canâ€™t get testing at a local healthcare facility.
