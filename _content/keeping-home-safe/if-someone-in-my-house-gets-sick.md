excerpt: Keeping your home safe
---

Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. [CDC has directions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html) for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

* Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.

### When to seek medical attention

* If you develop **emergency warning signs**<sup>1</sup> for COVID-19 get **medical attention immediately**:
  * Trouble breathing
  * Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
  * New confusion or inability to arouse
  * Bluish lips or face

**Call 911 if you have a medical emergency:** Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19. If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.

- Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
- If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
- Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
- [Clean the sick room and bathroom](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html), as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
- Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.
