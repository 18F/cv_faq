---

Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. [CDC has directions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html) for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

* Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.

### When to seek medical attention

* If you develop **emergency warning signs** for COVID-19 get **medical attention immediately**. Emergency warning signs include<sup>1</sup>:
  * Trouble breathing
  * Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
  * New confusion or inability to arouse
  * Bluish lips or face
* Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
* Clean hands regularly by handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
* Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
* [Clean the sick room and bathroom](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html), as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
* Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.
