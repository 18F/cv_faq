excerpt: Keeping your home safe
---

Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:

* Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan, and discuss [what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html).
* Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications, particularly [older adults and those with severe chronic medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) like heart, lung or kidney disease.
  * Make sure they have access to several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.
* Get to know your neighbors and find out if your neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected.
* Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare services, support, and resources.
* Create an emergency contact list of family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources.
