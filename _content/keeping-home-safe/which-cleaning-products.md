title: What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?
---

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDC's [recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html).
