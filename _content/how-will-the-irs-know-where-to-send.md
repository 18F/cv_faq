title: How will the IRS know where to send my payment?
---

The IRS will use the data already in their systems to send the new payments. Taxpayers **with** direct deposit information on file will receive the payment that way. For those **without** current direct deposit information on file, they will receive the payment as a check or debit card in the mail. For those eligible but who donâ€™t receive the payment for any reason, it can be claimed by filing a 2020 tax return in 2021. Remember, the Economic Impact Payments are an advance payment of what will be called the Recovery Rebate Credit on the 2020 Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR.
