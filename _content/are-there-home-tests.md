title: Are there any tests that I can purchase to test myself at home for COVID-19?
---

No, at this time, the FDA has not authorized any COVID-19 test to be completely used and processed at home. However, the FDA has issued [emergency use authorizations (EUAs)](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization)  for certain COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests to be used with samples collected by a person using a home collection kit that is sent to a laboratory for processing and test reporting. In general, a healthcare provider determines whether a person can use a home collection kit as explained in each testâ€™s EUA.

The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection options, and we are actively working with test developers to expand the use of such options.
