The [International Reagent Resource (IRR)](https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/) will distribute the diagnostic panel and most of the associated reagents to public health partners. CDC has also posted a list of commercially available [lots of primer and probe sets](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/List-of-Acceptable-Commercial-Primers-Probes.pdf) that have passed CDC functional QC and may be used with our CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.
