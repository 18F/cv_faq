## Take steps to protect yourself

### Clean your hands often

* **Wash your hands** often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
* If soap and water are not readily available, **use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol**. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
* **Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth** with unwashed hands.

### Avoid close contact

* **Avoid close contact** with people who are sick.
* Put **distance between yourself and other people** if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html"> people who are at higher risk of getting very sick</a>.

## Take step to protect others

### Stay home if you’re sick

* **Stay home** if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"> what to do if you are sick</a>.

### Cover coughs and sneezes

* **Cover your mouth and nose** with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
* Throw used tissues in the trash.
* Immediately **wash your hands** with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

### Wear a facemask if you are sick
* **If you are sick:** You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"> Learn what to do if you are sick</a>.
* **If you are NOT sick:** You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers. 

### Clean and disinfect
* **Clean AND disinfect <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html"> frequently touched surfaces daily</a>.** This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
* **If surfaces are dirty, clean them:** Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
* **To disinfect:** Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. Use disinfectants appropriate for the surface.
