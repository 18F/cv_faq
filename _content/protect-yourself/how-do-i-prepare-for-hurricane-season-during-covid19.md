title: How do I prepare for hurricane season during COVID-19?
---

Your planning may be different this year because of the need to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

* Give yourself more time than usual to [prepare your emergency food, water, and medicine supplies](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/before.html). Home delivery is the safest choice for buying disaster supplies; however, that may not be an option for everyone. If in-person shopping is your only choice, take steps to [protect your and others’ health when running essential errands](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html).
* Protect yourself and others when filling [prescriptions](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/prepareyourhealth/Prescriptions.htm) by limiting in-person visits to the pharmacy. Sign up for mail order delivery or call in your prescription ahead of time and use drive-through windows or curbside pickup, if available.
* Pay attention to local guidance about updated plans for evacuations and shelters, including [potential shelters for your pets](https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/emergencies/index.html).
* When you check on neighbors and friends, be sure to follow [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) recommendations (staying at least 6 feet, about 2 arms’ length, from others) and [other CDC recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) to protect yourself and others.
* If you need to go to a disaster shelter, follow CDC recommendations for staying safe and healthy in a [public disaster shelter](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/covid-19/public-disaster-shelter-during-covid.html) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
