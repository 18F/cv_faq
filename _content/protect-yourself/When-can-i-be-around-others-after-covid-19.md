title: When can I be around others after I had or likely had COVID-19?
---

You can be around others after:
- 10 days since symptoms first appeared and
- 24 hours with no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
- COVID-19 symptoms have improved (for example, cough, shortness of breath)

Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others; however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results.

Note that these recommendations do not apply to persons with severe COVID-19 or with severely weakened immune systems (immunocompromised). For more information, visit [CDCâ€™s guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html).
