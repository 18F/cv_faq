title: What should people do that have been exposed to hand sanitizer with potential methanol contamination? 
---

If you suspect you have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol, seek immediate medical treatment. 

Methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. People using products containing methanol on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning. Young children who accidentally swallow these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk.
