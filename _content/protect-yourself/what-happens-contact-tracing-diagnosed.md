title: What will happen during contact tracing if I am diagnosed with COVID-19?
---

If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you to check on your health, discuss who you have been around, and ask where you spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. You will also be asked to continue to stay at home and [self-isolate](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html), away from others.

- Your name **will not** be shared with those you came in contact with.
- The health department staff **will not** ask you for
  - Money
  - Social Security number
  - Bank account information
  - Salary information, or
  - Credit card numbers

- Self-isolation means staying at home in a specific room away from other people and [pets](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/animals/pets-other-animals.html), and using a separate bathroom, if possible.
- Self-isolation helps slow the spread of COVID-19 and can help protect the health of your family, friends, neighbors, and others you may come in contact.
- If you need support or assistance while in self-isolation, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance.

Watch for or monitor your [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care.
