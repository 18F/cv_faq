excerpt: How to protect yourself

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including
COVID-19. You should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who
have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms. This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. The use of facemasks
also is crucial for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Finfection-control.html"> health workers </a> and
other <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-home-care.html"> people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings </a> (at home or in a health care facility).
