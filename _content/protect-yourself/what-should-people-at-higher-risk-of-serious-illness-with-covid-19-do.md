excerpt: How to protect yourself
---

If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.

caregivers can support those at higher risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html).
