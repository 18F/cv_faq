title: How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light?
---

The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the [surface disinfectants identified on List N](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2) against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19.
