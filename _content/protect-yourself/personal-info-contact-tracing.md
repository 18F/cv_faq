title: What will happen to my personal information during contact tracing?
---

If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in [close contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact) with that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Each state and jurisdiction use their own method for collecting and protecting health information. To learn more, contact your state or local health department.â€‹
