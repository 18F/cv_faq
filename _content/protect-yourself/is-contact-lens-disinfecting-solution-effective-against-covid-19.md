- [Hydrogen peroxide-based systems](https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/care-systems.html) for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.
  - For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.
- [Always use solution](https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/care-systems.html) to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present.
- Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.
