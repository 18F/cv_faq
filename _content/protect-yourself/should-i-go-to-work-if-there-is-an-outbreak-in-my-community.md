title: Should I go to work if there is an outbreak in my community?
---

Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home or taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) or if your childâ€™s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
