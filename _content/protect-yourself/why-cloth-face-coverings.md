In light of new data about [how COVID-19 spreads](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html), along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a [cloth face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms.
