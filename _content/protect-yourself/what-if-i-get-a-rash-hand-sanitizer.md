title: What do I do if I get a rash or other reaction to hand sanitizer?
---

Call your doctor if you experience a serious reaction to hand sanitizer. FDA encourages consumers and health care professionals to report adverse events experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to the [FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program) program:

-   Complete and submit the report [online](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/index.cfm); or
-   Download and complete the [form](https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download), then submit it via fax at 1-800-FDA-0178.
-   Include as much information as you can about the product that caused the reaction, including the product name, the manufacturer, and the lot number (if available).

See [Safely Using Hand Sanitizer](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/safely-using-hand-sanitizer) for more information.
