Before disaster strikes, be ready with an evacuation plan. Check with local officials about what shelter spaces are available for this year. Coronavirus may have altered your community’s plans.
* Prepare a “go kit” with [personal items](https://www.ready.gov/kit) you cannot do without during an emergency. Include items that can help protect you and others from COVID-19, such as hand sanitizer, or bar or liquid soap if not available, and two cloth face coverings for each person.
* Face covers should not be used by children under the age of 2. They also should not be used by people having trouble breathing, or who are unconscious, incapacitated, or unable to remove the mask without assistance.

If you need to go to a disaster shelter, follow CDC recommendations for staying safe and healthy in a [public disaster shelter](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/covid-19/public-disaster-shelter-during-covid.html) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
