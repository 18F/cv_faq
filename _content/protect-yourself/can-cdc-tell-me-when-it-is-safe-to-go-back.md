title: Can CDC tell me or my employer when it is safe for me to go back to work/school
  after recovering from or being exposed to COVID-19?

CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. Employers, schools, and organizations may decide to visibly screen for symptoms or perform on-site symptom checks.

If your employer, school, or organization requires you to present documentation regarding COVID-19 before returning to work or school (for example, proof of a negative COVID-19 lab test if a test was performed), contact your healthcare provider to ask if he or she would be able to provide a form of documentation for you. Documentation of self-isolation and self-quarantine may not be possible.

CDC has [guidance for when and how people with COVID-19 can discontinue home isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html).

CDC also has [guidance for what people should do if they think they have been exposed or feel sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html).

In all cases, **follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department**. Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
