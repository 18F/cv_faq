What every American and community can do now to decrease the spread of the coronavirus

## All households
- Clean hands at the door and at regular intervals practice regular handwashing
- Create habits and reminders to avoid touching their face and cover coughs and sneezes
- Disinfect surfaces like doorknobs, tables, and handrails regularly
- Increase ventilation by opening windows or adjusting air conditioning

## Households with vulnerable seniors or those with significant underlying conditions
**Significant underlying conditions include heart, lung, and kidney disease,
diabetes, and conditions that suppress the immune system**

- Have the healthy people in the household conduct themselves as if they were a significant risk to the
person with underlying conditions. For example, wash hands frequently before interacting with the
person, such as by feeding or caring for the person
- If possible, provide a protected space for vulnerable household members
Ensure all utensils and surfaces are cleaned regularly

## Households with sick family members
- Give sick members their own room if possible, and keep the door closed
- Have only one family member care for them
- Consider providing additional protections or more intensive care for household members over 65
years old or with underlying conditions
