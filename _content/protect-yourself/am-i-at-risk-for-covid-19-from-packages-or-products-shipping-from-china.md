There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged
previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically
related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we donâ€™t know for sure
that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these
earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is
likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient
temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no
evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in
the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html"> Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website</a> as it becomes available.
