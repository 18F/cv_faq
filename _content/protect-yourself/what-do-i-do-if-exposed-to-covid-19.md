title: What should I do if I've been exposed to COVID-19, but do not yet know if I've been infected?

If you have had close contact with an infected person, stay home for 14 days and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others at all times. 

- Self-monitor for [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)
  - Check temperature twice a day
   - Watch for fever, cough, or shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19
- Avoid contact with people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19
- If symptoms develop, contact your health provider and follow CDC guidance
