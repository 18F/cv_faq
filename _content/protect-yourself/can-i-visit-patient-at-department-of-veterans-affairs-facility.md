title: Can I visit a patient at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility?
---

We're currently following CDC guidelines and limiting visitors for patients receiving care in a VA facility, including a hospital, nursing home, or spinal cord injury and disorder center. Limiting outside visitors helps us protect older Veterans and those who already have health issues.

We do make an exception for Veterans who qualify as a "compassionate case." This means the Veteran is in their last stage of life in a hospice unit and you can only visit that Veteran’s room. We know this is difficult for families, but we're taking these precautions to protect the most vulnerable patients from community spread of the coronavirus.
