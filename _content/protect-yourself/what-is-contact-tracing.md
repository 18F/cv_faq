title: What is contact tracing?
---

Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by
- Letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html);
- Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested; and
- Asking people to [self-isolate](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html) if they have COVID-19 or [self-quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) if they are in close contact with someone with COVID-19.

During contact tracing, the health department staff **will not** ask you for
- Money
- Social Security number
- Bank account information
- Salary information
- Credit card numbers
