If you have been around someone who was identified as a close contact to a person with COVID-19, closely monitor yourself for any [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). You do not need to self-quarantine unless you develop symptoms or if the person identified as a close contact develops COVID-19.
