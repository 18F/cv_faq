title: What is the FDA doing to protect people from products making fraudulent COVID-19 claims?
---

The FDA has established a cross-agency team dedicated to closely monitoring for [fraudulent COVID-19 products](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products). In response to internet scammers, the FDA has taken – and continues to take – actions to stop those selling unapproved products that fraudulently claim to prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issue warning letters to companies and individuals that are unlawfully selling unapproved products with fraudulent COVID-19 claims. 

The FDA also has taken enforcement action against certain sellers that continued to illegally market products for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. 

Additionally, the FDA also has reached out to major retailers to ask for their help in monitoring online marketplaces for fraudulent COVID-19 products. You can [report websites selling fraudulent medical products](https://www.fda.gov/safety/report-problem-fda/reporting-unlawful-sales-medical-products-internet) to the FDA through our website, by phone at 1-800-332-1088, or email the FDA at
