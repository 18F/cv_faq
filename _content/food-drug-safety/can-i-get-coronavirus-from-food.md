title: Can I get the coronavirus from food, food packaging, or food containers and preparation area?
---

Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects. 

If you are concerned about contamination of food or food packaging, wash your hands after handling food packaging, after removing food from the packaging, before you prepare food for eating, and before you eat. Consumers can follow [CDC guidelines on frequent hand washing](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; and frequently clean and disinfect surfaces.

It is always important to follow the 4 key steps of food safetyâ€”[clean, separate, cook, and chill](https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe/4-steps-to-food-safety).
