title: Are there any FDA-approved drugs (medicines) for COVID-19?
---

Currently there are no FDA-approved medicines specifically approved for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. During public health emergencies, the FDA may in certain circumstances authorize use of unapproved drugs or unapproved uses of approved drugs for life-threatening conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available options and other conditions are met. This is called an [Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#coviddrugs).

Researchers are studying new drugs, and medicines that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA created the [Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/coronavirus-covid-19-drugs/coronavirus-treatment-acceleration-program-ctap) to use every available method to move new treatments to patients. Additionally, the FDA is working with the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/activ), drug manufacturers, researchers, and [other partners](https://covid19.reaganudall.org/) to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. [FDAâ€™s Sentinel System](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/assessments/coronavirus-covid-19) is being used to monitor the use of drugs, describe the course of illness among hospitalized patients, and evaluate the treatment impact of therapies actively being used under real-world conditions.

For information about clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments visit clinicaltrials.gov and the [COVID-19 Prevention Network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/). Note: The information on clinicaltrials.gov is provided by the sponsor or principal investigator of a clinical trial. The listing of a study on the site does not reflect evaluation or endorsement of the trial by the Federal government.
