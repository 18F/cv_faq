title: Is there a list of essential industries and employees?
---

Yes. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has a list of essential industries, available online.

Those industries include:

- **Healthcare/Public Health** (i.e. hospitals and doctors)
- **Law Enforcement, Public Safety and First Responders** (i.e. police and Emergency Management Services)
- **Food and Agriculture** (i.e. farmers and food manufacturers)
- **Energy** (i.e. natural gas and nuclear facilities)
- **Water and Waste water** (i.e. water department)
- **Transportation and Logistics** (i.e. trucking and shipping)
- **Public Works and Infrastructure** (i.e. safety inspectors for public facilities including dams, bridges, etc.)
- **Communications and Information Technology** (i.e. maintainers of communications infrastructure, such as wireless, internet and cable providers)
- **Community and Local Government** (i.e. federal, state, local, tribal and territorial employees who support Mission Essential Functions)
- **Critical Manufacturing** (i.e. metals, PPE, supply chain minerals and employees that support other essential services)
- **Hazardous Materials** (i.e. healthcare waste and nuclear facilities)
- **Financial Services** (i.e. banks)
- **Chemical** (i.e. workers supporting the chemical and industrial gas supply chains)
- **Defense Industrial** (i.e. essential services required to meet national security commitments to the federal government and U.S. Military)
- **Commercial Facilities** (i.e. workers who support the supply chain of building materials)
- **Residential/Shelter Facilities** (i.e.  workers in dependent care services)
- **Hygiene Products and Services** (i.e. laundromats, personal and household goods repair and maintenance)

While this guidance is not a federal mandate, and final decisions remain at the state and local levels, we firmly believe it can serve as a baseline for a common national approach in prioritizing essential services and workers.
