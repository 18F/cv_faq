Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-Based Precautions described below.

Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in respiratory specimens. Criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions can be found in: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html"> Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19</a>
