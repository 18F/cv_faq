Healthcare providers should consult with local or state health departments to determine whether patients meet <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html"> criteria for a Persons Under Investigation (PUI)</a>. Providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient.
