## Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare or community settings with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI? ##

Wastewater workers should use standard practices including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/sanitation/workers_handlingwaste.html"> basic hygiene precautions</a> and wear the recommended <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/sanitation/workers_handlingwaste.html"> 
PPE</a> as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19.
