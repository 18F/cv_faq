Currently, two vaccines are authorized and recommended to prevent COVID-19. The [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine) has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on December 11, 2020. The [Moderna COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/moderna-covid-19-vaccine) has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on December 18, 2020. Both are currently being administered in the U.S.

As of December 28, 2020, large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials are in progress or being planned for three COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.
