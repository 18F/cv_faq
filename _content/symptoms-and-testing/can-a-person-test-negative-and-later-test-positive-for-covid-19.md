excerpt: Symptoms and testing
---

Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the personâ€™s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.

For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
