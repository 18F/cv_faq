Many tests to diagnose COVID-19 have received an [Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations) from the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasopharyngeal swabs.

Locations and types of testing sites may vary by state or territory (see question: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses. You can find a [patient information sheet for each test](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd) on the FDA site.

Be aware that at this time, no home tests have been authorized for use. All tests must be done at a testing site. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding testing that may include home collection, and they are actively working with test developers on this goal.
