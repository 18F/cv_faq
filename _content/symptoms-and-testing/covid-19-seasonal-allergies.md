title: What is the difference between COVID-19 and seasonal allergies?
---

COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19). Seasonal allergies triggered by airborne pollen can lead to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which affects the nose and sinuses, and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, which affects the eyes.

COVID-19 and seasonal allergies share many symptoms, but there are some key differences between the two. For example, COVID-19 can cause fever, which is not a common symptom of seasonal allergies. 

**Symptoms more common of COVID-19**
- Fever and chills
- Muscle and body aches
- New loss of taste or smell
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea

**Symptoms more common of seasonal allergies**
- Itchy or watery eyes
- Sneezing

**Symptoms common of both**
- Cough
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. (Seasonal allergies do not usually cause shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, unless a person has a respiratory condition such as asthma that can be triggered by exposure to pollen.)
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Sore throat
- Congestion or runny nose

Because some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal allergies are similar, it may be difficult to tell the difference between them, and you may need to get a test to confirm your diagnosis.

This is not a complete list of all possible symptoms of COVID-19 or seasonal allergies. Symptoms vary from person to person and range from mild to severe. You can have symptoms of both COVID-19 and seasonal allergies at the same time.

If you think you have COVID-19, follow CDCâ€™s guidance on "[What to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html)." If you have an [emergency warning sign](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#seek-medical-attention) (including trouble breathing), seek emergency medical care immediately.
