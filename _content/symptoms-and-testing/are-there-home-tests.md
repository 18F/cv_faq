title: Are there any tests that I can purchase to test myself at home for COVID-19?
---

At this time, the FDA has not authorized any test that is available to purchase for testing yourself at home for COVID-19. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection, and we are actively working with test developers on this goal. You can find [listings of tests](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2#offeringtests) that have received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as well as labs and manufacturers that have notified FDA as set forth in the FDA\'s [Policy for Diagnostic Tests for Coronavirus Disease-2019](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy-diagnostic-tests-coronavirus-disease-2019-during-public-health-emergency).
