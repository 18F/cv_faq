title: Where can I get tested for COVID-19?
---

The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested. See [Testing for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html) for more information.
