title: Should I be tested for COVID-19?

Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.

If you have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.

You can also visit your state or local health departmentâ€™s website to look for the latest local information on testing. See [Test for Past Infection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html) for more information.
