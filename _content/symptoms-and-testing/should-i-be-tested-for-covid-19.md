If you develop symptoms such as fever, cough, and/or difficulty breathing, and have been in close contact with a person 
known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled from an area with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Ftransmission.html"> ongoing spread of COVID-19</a>, stay home and call your 
healthcare provider. Older patients and individuals who have severe underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised 
should contact their healthcare provider early, even if their illness is mild. If you have severe symptoms, such as persistent 
pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips of face, contact your healthcare provider 
or emergency room and seek care immediately. Your doctor will determine if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and whether 
you should be tested.
