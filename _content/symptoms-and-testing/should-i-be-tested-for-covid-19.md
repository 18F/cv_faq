title: Should I be tested for COVID-19?
---

Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.

If you have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. Most people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.

CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments and healthcare providers.

You can also visit your state or local health departmentâ€™s website to look for the latest local information on testing.
