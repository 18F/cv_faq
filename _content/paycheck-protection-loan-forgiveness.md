title: How do I get my Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiven?
---

Paycheck Protection Program borrowers may be eligible for full or partial loan forgiveness.  Forgiveness applications are made through a borrower’s lender of record once all loan proceeds for which the borrower is requesting forgiveness have been used.
 
Borrowers can apply for forgiveness through their lender any time up to the maturity date of the loan. If borrowers do not apply for forgiveness within 10 months after the last day of the covered period, then PPP loan payments are no longer deferred, and borrowers will begin making loan payments to their PPP lender.
 
Visit the [SBA’s PPP Loan Forgiveness page](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-loan-forgiveness) for more information and links to general forgiveness forms that have the information required to be collected by your lender.
