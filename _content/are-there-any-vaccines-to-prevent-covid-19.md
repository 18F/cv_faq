title: Are there any FDA-approved drugs (medicines) for COVID-19?
---

The FDA has [approved Veklury (remdesivir)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-covid-19) for certain COVID-19 patients. 

During public health emergencies, the FDA may in certain circumstances authorize use of unapproved drugs or unapproved uses of approved drugs for life-threatening conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available options and other conditions are met. This is called an [Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#coviddrugs).

The FDA is scheduled to meet in December to discuss the request for EUA for a potential vaccine.
