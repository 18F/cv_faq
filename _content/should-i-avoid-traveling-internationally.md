title: Should I avoid traveling internationally?
---

Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 risk in most countries is high, and travelers should avoid nonessential travel to high-risk destinations. Travelers at [increased risk for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html) should consider postponing all travel, including essential travel, to high-risk destinations. To check a destinationâ€™s COVID-19 risk level see [COVID-19 Travel Recommendations by Destination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html).

Some healthcare systems are overwhelmed and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be disrupted. If you get sick or are exposed to a person with COVID-19 during your trip, you may be isolated or quarantined and your return to the United States may be delayed.

CDC also recommends all travelers [put off all cruise ship travel worldwide](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship).
