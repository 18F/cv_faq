title: Should I trust ads for products that say they can prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19?

No. According to the FDA, there are currently no products or treatments available to the public that can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. Some sellers may offer “treatments” in clinics or medical offices, including intravenous Vitamin C and D infusions, stem cell therapy, and immunity boosting shots. However, these are not FDA approved treatments. Any claims to the contrary are false. If you’re tempted to buy an unproven product or one with questionable claims, check with your doctor or other health care professional first.
