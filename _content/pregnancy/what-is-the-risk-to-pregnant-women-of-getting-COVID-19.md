excerpt: Pregnant women and COVID-19
---

We do not currently know if pregnant people have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. Based on available information, **pregnant people seem to have the same risk as adults who are not pregnant**.

However, we do know that:

- Pregnant people have changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections.
- Pregnant people have had a higher risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza.
