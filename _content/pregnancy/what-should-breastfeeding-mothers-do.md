This interim guidance is intended for women who are confirmed to have COVID-19 or are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html"> persons-under-investigation (PUI)</a> for COVID-19 and are currently breastfeeding. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and the transmission of other viral respiratory infections. CDC will update this interim guidance as needed as additional information becomes available. For breastfeeding guidance in the immediate postpartum setting, refer to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/inpatient-obstetric-healthcare-guidance.html"> Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of 2019 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings</a>.

**Transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk**

Much is unknown about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html"> how COVID-19 is spread</a>. Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza (flu) and other respiratory pathogens spread. In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk.

**CDC breastfeeding guidance for other infectious illnesses**

Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses. There are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/contraindications-to-breastfeeding.html"> rare exceptions when breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk is not recommended</a>. CDC has no specific guidance for breastfeeding during infection with similar viruses like SARS-CoV or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).

Outside of the immediate postpartum setting, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/maternal-or-infant-illnesses/influenza.html">  CDC recommends that a mother with flu continue breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to her infant</a> while taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant.

### Guidance on breastfeeding for mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or under investigation for COVID-19 ###

Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for most infants. However, much is unknown about COVID-19. Whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding should be determined by the mother in coordination with her family and healthcare providers.  A mother with confirmed COVID-19 or who is a symptomatic PUI should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html"> take all possible precautions</a> to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast.  If expressing breast milk with a manual or electric breast pump, the mother should wash her hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/healthychildcare/infantfeeding/breastpump.html"> recommendations</a> for proper pump cleaning after each use. If possible, consider having someone who is well feed the expressed breast milk to the infant.
