- **Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses** and is the best source of nutrition for most infants.
- You, along with your family and healthcare providers, should decide whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding
- **In limited studies, COVID-19 has not been detected in breast milk**; however we do not know for sure whether mothers with COVID-19 can spread the virus via breast milk.
- If you are sick and choose to **direct breastfeed**:
  - Wear a facemask and wash your hands before each feeding.
- If the you are sick and choose to **express breast milk**:
  - Express breast milk to establish and maintain milk supply.
  - A dedicated breast pump should be provided.
  - Wash hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and before expressing breast milk.
  - Follow **recommendations for proper pump cleaning** after each use, cleaning all parts that come into contact with breast milk.
  - If possible, consider having someone who is well feed the expressed breast milk to the infant.
