Pregnant women should do the same things as the general public to avoid infection. You can help stop the spread of COVID-19 by taking these actions:
* Cover your cough (using your elbow is a good technique)
* Avoid people who are sick
* Clean your hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer
