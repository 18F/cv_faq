title: I am pregnant and worried about COVID-19. What are the risks to me and my baby?
---

Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19.

Much is still unknown about the risks of COVID-19 to newborns.

- Newborns can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after being in close contact with an infected person.
- Some babies have tested positive for the virus shortly after birth. It is unknown if these babies got the virus before, during, or after birth.
- Most newborns who have tested positive for COVID-19 had mild or no symptoms and have recovered fully. However, there are a few reports of newborns with severe illness.
- A small number of other problems, such as preterm (early) birth and other problems with pregnancy and birth, have been reported in babies born to mothers who tested positive for COVID-19. We do not know if these problems were related to the virus.
