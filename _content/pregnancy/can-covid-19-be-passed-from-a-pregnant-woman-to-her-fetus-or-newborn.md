title: Can COVID-19 be passed from mother to child?
---

Based on what we know at this time, **pregnant people might be at increased risk** for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19. Therefore, if you are pregnant, be mindful about reducing your risk of getting sick. If you are caring for children, you can teach them [everyday steps](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) (such as proper [handwashing](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html)) to help them stay healthy and, in turn, help protect yourself and your family.
