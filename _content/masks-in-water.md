title: Can cloth masks be worn in the water?
---

No, do **NOT** wear a cloth mask in the water. It can be difficult to breathe through a cloth mask when it is wet. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. All of this means it is particularly important to [stay at least 6 feet apart](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) in the water from people you don’t live with.

In case cloth masks do get wet by mistake, bring a second (or extra) cloth mask for everyone heading out to the public [pool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/parks-rec/aquatic-venues.html) or [beach](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/parks-rec/public-beaches.html).
