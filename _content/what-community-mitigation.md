title: What is community mitigation?
---

Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at [increased risk for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html), while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies. For more information, see [Community Mitigation Framework](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/community-mitigation.html).
