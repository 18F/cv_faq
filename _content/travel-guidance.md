title: What guidance should I follow when traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic?
---

Before you travel, consider the following:

- **Is COVID-19 spreading at your destination?** The more cases at your destination, the more likely you are to get infected during travel and spread the virus to others when you return.
- [Check Each State’s Cases in the Last 7 Days](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days)
- [Travel Recommendations for Destinations Around the World](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html)
- **Do you live with someone who might be at [increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19?](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html)** If you get infected while traveling, you can spread the virus to loved ones when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms.
- **Are you at [increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html?)** Anyone can get very ill from the virus that causes COVID-19, but older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
- **Does your destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers?** Some state, local, and territorial governments have requirements, such as requiring people to wear masks and requiring those who recently traveled to stay home for up to 14 days. Check [state, territorial](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html), [tribal](https://www.cdc.gov/tribal/index.html) and local public health websites for information before you travel. If you are traveling internationally, check the destination’s Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health or the [U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html) for details about entry requirements and restrictions for arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or [quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html).

During your trip, take steps to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) from COVID-19:

- Wear a [mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings, including on [public transportation and in transportation hubs such as airports and stations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html).
- Avoid close contact by [staying at least 6 feet apart](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) (about 2 arms’ length) from anyone who is not from your household.
- [Wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).
- Avoid contact with anyone who is sick.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
- At bathrooms and rest stops, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom and after you have been in a public place. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
- When getting gas, Use disinfecting wipes on handles and buttons at the gas pumps before you touch them (if available). After fueling, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. When you get to your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
- Research the COVID-19 policies of hotels and accommodations, to see if they wear masks. Choose contactless check-in options, if available. See [advice for traveling overnight](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#Traveling%20overnight).
- The safest option is to bring your own food. If you don’t bring your own food, [use drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick-up options](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html#deliver).
