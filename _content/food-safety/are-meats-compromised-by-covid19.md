title: Are meat products compromised by COVID-19?
---

We are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging. However, it is always important to follow [good hygiene practices](https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe/4-steps-to-food-safety) (i.e., wash hands and surfaces often, separate raw meat from other foods, cook to the right temperature, and refrigerate foods promptly) when handling or preparing foods.
