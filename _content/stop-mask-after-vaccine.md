title: When can I stop wearing a mask and avoiding close contact with others after I have been vaccinated?
---

Not enough information is currently available to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people [wear masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) and [avoid close contact with others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) to help prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide in real-world conditions before making that decision. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision. We also don’t yet know whether getting a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to other people, even if you don’t get sick yourself. CDC will continue to provide updates as we learn more.

While experts learn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using **all the tools** available to help stop this pandemic.

To protect yourself and others, follow these recommendations:

- Wear a mask over your nose and mouth
- Stay at least 6 feet away from others
- Avoid crowds
- Avoid poorly ventilated spaces
- Wash your hands often

Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations for [how to protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19.
