title: How can I check the status of my Economic Impact Payment (stimulus check)?
---

Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus checks or stimulus payments, are payments available to eligible taxpayers to help reduce the financial burden of COVID-19. [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) is a service of the IRS that allows you to check the status of your Economic Impact Payment, including the date the check was mailed or the funds will be in your bank account using direct deposit. 

Visit the IRS's [Get My Payment Frequently Asked Questions page](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment-frequently-asked-questions) to answer your questions about using the service.

Data is updated once per day overnight, so there's no need to check more than once per day.

Please do not call the IRS about the second stimulus payment; phone assistants do not have additional information beyond whatâ€™s available here on IRS.gov and in the Get My Payment application.
