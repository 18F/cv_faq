title: Where can I get information about Get My Payment?
---

Visit our [Get My Payment Frequently Asked Questions page](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment-frequently-asked-questions) to answer your questions about using the application.

Data is updated once per day overnight, so there's no need to check more than once per day.

Please do not call the IRS about the second stimulus payment; our phone assistants do not have additional information beyond whatâ€™s available here on IRS.gov and in the Get My Payment application.
