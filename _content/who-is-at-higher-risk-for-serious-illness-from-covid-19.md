title: Who is at increased risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19?
---

[People at increased risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html) include:

- [Older adults](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html)
- [People of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html)

Pregnant people are also at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from [racial and ethnic minority groups](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html) at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19.

In addition to those at increased risk, there are [certain groups of people who require extra precautions during the pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations.html).
