During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:

### [Protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html) ###

* Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible by keeping about 6 feet away.

### Put your household plan into action ###

* **Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation.** Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily routine.
* **Continue practicing everyday preventive actions.** Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.
* **Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes.** Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html), or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily.

* **Stay in touch with others by phone or email.** If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and healthcare providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.
