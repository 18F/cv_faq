Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. [Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.](https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/helping-children-cope.html)
