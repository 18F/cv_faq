title: How can I protect myself from seasonal allergies?
---

The best way to protect yourself against seasonal allergies is to reduce your exposure to pollen. During high pollen days:

- Limit your time outdoors and seek indoor spaces with clean air.
- Create a cleaner air space at home to protect yourself from outdoor air irritants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Use a portable air cleaner in one or more rooms. Portable air cleaners work best when run continuously with doors and windows closed. [Do-it-yourself box fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukyF2xm8cws&feature=youtu.be) (video) filtration units are a low-cost filtration alternative, but they should never be left unattended.
- Keep your cleaner air space a comfortable temperature by using air conditioners, heat pumps, fans, and window shades.
- If you have a forced air system in your home, consult a qualified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professional about different filters (HEPA or MERV-13 or higher) and settings (“Recirculate” and “On” rather than “Auto”) that can be used to reduce indoor air irritants.
- If outdoors, avoid activities that stir up pollen, such as mowing lawns or raking leaves. When you return indoors, take a shower and change your clothes.

The EPA website on [indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) and the [EPA Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf) (PDF) provide additional information on improving indoor air quality. You can also find out the daily pollen levels in your area by checking local weather forecasts and [pollen counting stations](https://www.aaaai.org/global/nab-pollen-counts?ipb=1).
