title: Can I schedule a committal service or a military funeral honors service?
---

Not at this time. For the safety of volunteers, families, and staff, national cemeteries wonâ€™t be conducting committal services or rendering military funeral honors until further notice. Families are welcomed to proceed with a direct interment at this time and schedule a committal service and military honors for a later date once normal operations resume.
