title: Can I still schedule a burial at a national cemetary?
---

Yes. To schedule an interment, contact the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at 800-535-1117. VA national cemeteries remain open for direct interments of Veterans and eligible dependents. Immediate family members (limited to 10 individuals) of the deceased can witness the interment, if requested and approved by the cemetery.

If you would like to cancel or postpone an interment thatâ€™s already scheduled, please contact the cemetery directly to cancel the service and to reschedule future services when ready.
