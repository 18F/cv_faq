title: I was around someone who has COVID-19, and my COVID-19 test came back negative. Do I still need to quarantine for 14 days after I was last exposed?

**Yes.** You should still self-quarantine for 14 days since your last exposure. It can take up to 14 days after exposure to the virus for a person to develop COVID-19 symptoms. A negative result before end of the 14-day quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. By self-quarantining for 14 days, you lower the chance of possibly exposing others to COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself and others is to [stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-options-to-reduce-quarantine.html). Check your [local health department’s website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/hd-search/index.html) for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period.
