title: If I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine when itâ€™s available?

A COVID-19 vaccination should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had the COVID-19 infection. You should not be required to have an antibody test before you are vaccinated.

However, anyone currently infected with COVID-19 should wait to get vaccinated until after their illness has resolved and after they have met the [criteria](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html) to stop isolation.

Additionally, current evidence suggests that reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection. Therefore, people with a recent infection may delay vaccination until the end of that 90-day period if they choose to.
