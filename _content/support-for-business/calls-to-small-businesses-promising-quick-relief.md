Some [scammers may try](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/04/small-businesses-where-go-financial-relief-information) calling businesses and impersonating someone from a financial institution or government agency.

Applying for a loan was a step-by-step process before the coronavirus crisis and it’s a step-by-step process now. That’s why the SBA’s [sba.gov/coronavirus](https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources) site is the safest place for you to start.
