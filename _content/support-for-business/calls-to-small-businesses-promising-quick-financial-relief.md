title: I was contacted by someone who said they were affiliated with the SBA and can help me get a SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. Is this a scam?

Some companies are taking advantage of the pandemic to engage in unethical behavior by promising expedited relief or fast help getting a PPP loan. In June, the [FTC and SBA sent warning letters](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2020/06/ftc-sba-warning-letters-caution-against-misleading-loan) to companies that may be misleading small businesses seeking SBA loans as a result of the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.

In addition, the application deadline for the PPP loans was August 8, 2020.

Remember, applying for a loan was a step-by-step process before the coronavirus crisis and itâ€™s a step-by-step process now. To find legitimate information about PPP loans, visit [sba.gov/coronavirus](https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources).
