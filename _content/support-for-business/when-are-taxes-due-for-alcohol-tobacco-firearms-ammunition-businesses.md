title: When are taxes due for alcohol, tobacco, firearms, or ammunition businesses?
---

The Treasury Department is delaying tax payment due dates for wine, beer, distilled spirits, tobacco products, firearms, and ammunition excise taxes to provide flexibility for businesses that have been hurt by the coronavirus. Tax payments that were originally due between March 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020 can now be delayed for up to 90 days after the original due date. If businesses are in need of additional support, they may contact the [Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau](https://www.ttb.gov/contact-nrc) (TTB).
