title: What kind of tests are used to diagnose COVID-19?
---

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests.

- A [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) tells you if you have a current infection.
- An [antibody test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html) might tell you if you had a past infection. 

[Find out who should get tested.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html#who-should-get-tested) Protect yourself and others. Wear a mask, wash hands often, and stay 6 feet from others.
