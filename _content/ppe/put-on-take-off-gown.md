Check to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and doff PPE. The procedure to don and doff should be tailored to the specific type of PPE that you have available at your facility.

If your facility does not have specific guidance, [the CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing of PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/PPE-Sequence-508.pdf).

It is important for health care providers (HCP) to perform hand hygiene before and after removing PPE. Hand hygiene should be performed by using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
