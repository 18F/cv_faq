CDC does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings (in the community). Most often, [spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html) of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among [close contacts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html) (within 6 feet). CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue. People who are sick should [stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html) and not go into crowded public places or visit people in hospitals. Workers who are sick should follow CDC guidelines and [stay home when they are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/business/stay-home-when-sick.htm).
