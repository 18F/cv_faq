The [NIOSH approval number and approval label](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest2.html) are key to identifying NIOSH-approved respirators. The NIOSH approval label can be found on or within the packaging of the respirator or sometimes on the respirator itself. The required labeling of [NIOSH-Approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/N95-Infographic-Mask-Labeling-508.pdf) includes the NIOSH name, the approval number, filter designations, lot number, and model number to be printed on the respirator. You can verify that your respirator approvals are valid by checking the [NIOSH Certified Equipment List (CEL)](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel/default.html).
