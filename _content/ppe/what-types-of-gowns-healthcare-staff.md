While the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not fully understood, gowns are available that protect against microorganisms. The choice of gown should be made based on the level of risk of contamination. Certain areas of surgical and isolation gowns are defined as “critical zones” where direct contact with blood, body fluids, and/or other potentially infectious materials is most likely to occur. [(ANSI/AAMI PB70)](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf)

If there is a medium to high risk of contamination and need for a large critical zone, isolation gowns that claim moderate to high barrier protection [(ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4)](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf) can be used.

For healthcare activities with low, medium, or high risk of contamination, surgical gowns [(ANSI/AAMI PB70 Levels 1-4)](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf) can be used. These gowns are intended to be worn by healthcare personnel during surgical procedures.

If the risk of bodily fluid exposure is low or minimal, gowns that claim minimal or low levels of barrier protection [(ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2)](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf) can be used. These gowns should not be worn during surgical or invasive procedures, or for medium to high risk contamination patient care activities.
