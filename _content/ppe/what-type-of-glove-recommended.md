Nonsterile disposable patient examination gloves, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

What standards should be considered when choosing gloves?

The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed standards for patient examination gloves.

Standard specifications for nitrile gloves, natural rubber gloves, and polychloroprene gloves indicate higher minimum tensile strength and elongation requirements compared to vinyl gloves.<sup>1, 2, 3, 4</sup>

The ASTM has developed standards for patient examination gloves. Length requirements for patient exam gloves must be a minimum of 220mm-230mm depending on glove size and material type.<sup>1, 2, 3, 4</sup>
