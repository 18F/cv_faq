CDC's guidance for [Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/protectiveclothing/) outlines the scientific evidence and information on national and international standards, test methods, and specifications for fluid-resistant and impermeable gowns and coveralls used in healthcare.

Many organizations have published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical settings. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI): [ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf) describes the liquid barrier performance and a classification of surgical and isolation gowns for use in health care facilities.

As with any type of PPE, the key to proper selection and use of protective clothing is to understand the hazards and the risk of exposure. Some of the factors important to assessing the risk of exposure in health facilities include source, modes of transmission, pressures and types of contact, and duration and type of tasks to be performed by the user of the PPE. ([Technical Information Report (TIR) 11](http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/TIR110511preview.pdf), [[AAMI 2005]](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/protectiveclothing/#references)).

For gowns, it is important to have sufficient overlap of the fabric so that it wraps around the body to cover the back (ensuring that if the wearer squats or sits down, the gown still protects the back area of the body).
