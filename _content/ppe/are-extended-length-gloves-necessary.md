According to [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/infection-control.html), extended length gloves are not necessary when providing care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Extended length gloves can be used, but CDC is not specifically recommending them at this time.
