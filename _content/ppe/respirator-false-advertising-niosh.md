When NIOSH becomes aware of counterfeit respirators or those misrepresenting NIOSH approval on the market, these respirators are posted on the [Counterfeit Respirators / Misrepresentation of NIOSH-Approval](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/counterfeitResp.html) webpage to alert users, purchasers, and manufacturers.
