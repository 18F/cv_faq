After travel, all travelers should take these actions to protect others from getting sick:

- [Stay at least 6 feet](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) (about 2 arms’ length) from anyone who is not from your household. It’s important to do this everywhere — both indoors and outdoors.
- Wear a [mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) to keep your nose and mouth when you are outside of your home.
- [Wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) often or use hand sanitizer.
- Watch your health: Look for [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) of COVID-19, and take your temperature if you feel sick.
- See CDC’s [After Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html) webpage to learn if you should take additional precautions.

Follow [state, territorial](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html), [tribal](https://www.cdc.gov/tribal/index.html), and local recommendations or requirements.
