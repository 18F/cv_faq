The best way to protect yourself and others is to [stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-options-to-reduce-quarantine.html). Check your [local health department’s website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/hd-search/index.html) for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period.

- Be alert for [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19. 
- If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.
