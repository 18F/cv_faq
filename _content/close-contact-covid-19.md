- [Stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19. 
- Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) of COVID-19. 
- If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.
