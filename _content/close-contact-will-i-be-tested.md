title: If I am a close contact, will I be tested for COVID-19?
---

If you have been in [close contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact) with someone who has COVID-19, you should be tested, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area.

- While you are waiting for your COVID-19 test result, stay home away from others ([self-quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html)) and monitor your health for [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) to protect your friends, family, and others from possibly getting COVID-19.
- If your test is positive, you should continue to stay home and [self-isolate](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html) away from others and monitor your health. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and they worsen or become severe, you should seek emergency medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. Someone from the health department may call you to
  - Check on your health, 
  - Discuss who you have been around, and
  - Ask where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others.
- The best way to protect yourself and others is to [stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-options-to-reduce-quarantine.html). Check your [local health department’s website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/hd-search/index.html) for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period.
- If your test is negative and you don’t have symptoms, you should continue to stay home and [self-quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. This is important because symptoms can appear up to 14 days after you’ve been exposed and are infected. A negative result before the end of your quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. Additionally, you do not need a repeat test unless you develop symptoms, or if you require a test to return to work.
- If your test is negative and you have symptoms, you should continue to self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. Additional medical consultation and a second test may be needed if your symptoms do not improve.
