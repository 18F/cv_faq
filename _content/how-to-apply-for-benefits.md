title: How do I apply for small business or self-employment benefits?

The Paycheck Protection Program is one option for you to consider. The PPP can be a forgivable loan that keeps employees receiving their paychecks and connected with their health insurance benefits during this unprecedented time.
 
The program re-opened to applications from all participating lenders on January 18, 2021. Independent contractors and self-employed individuals can apply for the program through their PPP-participating lender. You should consult with your local lender as to whether it is participating.
 
First and Second Draw PPP loans have the same terms regardless of lender or borrower. Find [details on PPP loans](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-loan-forgiveness).
 
While borrower applications are made through your lending institution, the information required can be found on the [SBA First Draw Borrower Application Form](https://www.sba.gov/document/sba-form-2483-ppp-first-draw-borrower-application-form) or [SBA Second Draw Borrower Application Form](https://www.sba.gov/document/sba-form-2483-sd-ppp-second-draw-borrower-application-form). Each program has different application requirements.
