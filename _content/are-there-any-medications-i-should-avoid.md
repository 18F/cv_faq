title: Are there any medications I should avoid taking if I have COVID-19?
---

Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that taking any specific medications, like blood pressure medication or ibuprofen, leads to more severe illness from COVID-19.

Continue to take your medications and to follow your treatment plan as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Any changes to your medications should only be made after talking with your healthcare provider.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions or concerns.
