title: Are there special considerations on who should get the COVID-19 vaccine first?
---

At first, there may be a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccine(s). Operation Warp Speed will work to get those first vaccine doses out once a vaccine is authorized or approved and recommended, rather than waiting until there are enough vaccines for everyone. However, it is important that the initial vaccines are given to people in a fair, ethical, and transparent way. Learn how [CDC is making COVID-19 vaccine recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations-process.html), including recommendations if there is a limited supply, based on input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).
