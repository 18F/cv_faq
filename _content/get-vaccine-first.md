title: Are there special considerations on who should get the COVID-19 vaccine first?
---

CDC is making recommendations for who should be offered COVID-19 vaccine first when supplies are limited. To help guide decisions about how to distribute limited initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccine, CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have published recommendations for which groups should be vaccinated first. The goal is for everyone to be able to easily get a COVID-19 vaccination as soon as large quantities of vaccine are available.

While CDC makes recommendations for who should be offered COVID-19 vaccine first, each state has its own plan for vaccine prioritization, distribution, and allocation. Please contact your [state health department](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) for more information on their planning for COVID-19 vaccines.
