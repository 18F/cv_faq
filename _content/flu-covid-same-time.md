title: Can I get flu and COVID-19 at the same time?
---

Yes. It is possible to have the flu, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 at the same time. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. Testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.
 
The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated every year. Flu vaccines will not prevent COVID-19, but they will reduce your chances of getting flu. See [Prevent Seasonal Flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/index.html) for more information.
