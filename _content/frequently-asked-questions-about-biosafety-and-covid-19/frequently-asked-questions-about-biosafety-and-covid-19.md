## Frequently Asked Questions about Biosafety and COVID-19 ##

### Specimen Handling ###

#### How should the laboratory perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks? ####

Risk assessments and mitigation are dependent on the procedures to be performed, identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures, the competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures, the laboratory equipment and facility, and the resources available. Risk assessments should try to identify what could go wrong, and how the laboratory will mitigate those risks.

* [World Health Organization Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 3rd](https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/Biosafety7.pdf?ua=1)

#### Are certified Class II biological safety cabinets (BSCs) required to process COVID-19 specimens? Should laboratory staff put procedures in place to minimize personnel exposure if there is no certified Class II BSC? ####

Clinical laboratories that perform routine diagnostic tests on serum, stool, blood, or urine specimens should follow standard laboratory practices, including Standard Precautions, when handling potential COVID-19 patient specimens. However, any procedure with the potential to generate aerosols or droplets (e.g., vortexing, centrifuging, pipetting) should be performed in a certified Class II BSC. If no certified Class II BSC is available, or if instruments (e.g., centrifuges, analyzers, automated extraction equipment) cannot be used inside a BSC, extra precautions can be used to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel. Examples of these precautions include using additional personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., mask, respirator, face shield) or other physical barriers (e.g., splash shield, centrifuge safety cups, sealed centrifuge rotors) to reduce the risk of exposure to laboratory personnel.

#### What biosafety level is recommended for handling clinical specimens from suspected COVID-19 PUIs? ####

In clinical laboratories, personnel handling respiratory specimens, whole blood, serum, plasma, and urine specimens should use Standard Precautions at BSL-2. Conduct work using intact, full-length genomic RNA at BSL-2 (BMBL 6thed.– prepublication). Personnel should perform site- and activity-specific risk assessments to determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs.

#### How should personnel remove biohazardous waste from the laboratory or testing area for decontamination and disposal? Does an autoclave need to be available in the facility? ####

For waste associated with testing clinical specimens from suspected COVID-19 PUIs, personnel should follow standard procedures associated with other respiratory pathogens, such as seasonal influenza and other human coronaviruses. Biohazardous waste containers should be leakproof and closed prior to removal from the laboratory for decontamination. If there is no autoclave onsite, then pack waste in accordance with institutional policy and procedures.

For additional information, refer to the following:

* [Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (5th edition)](https://www.cdc.gov/labs/pdf/CDC-BiosafetyMicrobiologicalBiomedicalLaboratories-2009-P.PDF)

#### How should staff members transport clinical specimens from suspected COVID-19 PUIs within a facility? ####

Staff members should adhere to standard procedures associated with other respiratory pathogens, such as seasonal influenza and other human coronaviruses when they transport specimens within a facility. Personnel should perform site- and activity-specific risk assessments to determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs.

#### What are Standard Precautions? ####

Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and excretions (except sweat) may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions practices include hand hygiene, and the use of laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, eye protection or face shields, and masks, depending on the anticipated exposure.

In addition, Standard Precautions include protection of mucous membranes (eyes, nose, and mouth) for any procedures with the potential to generate infectious aerosols or droplets (e.g,. centrifuging, vortexing, pipetting, removing tube caps).

For additional information, refer to the following:

* [2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settingspdf icon](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/guidelines/isolation-guidelines-H.pdf)
* [CDC Isolation Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html#5)

#### What are infectious aerosols and droplets? ####

**Aerosols and droplets*** containing particles that are <100 μm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles could be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment.

**Infectious aerosols** are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents.  They can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. These particles are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (<5 μm in diameter).

Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of _Aspergillus_ spp., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox).

**Droplets** traditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (>5 μm in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure.

Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include _Bordetella pertussis_, influenza viruses, adenovirus, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and _Neisseria meningitidis_.

* [CDC Isolation Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html#5)

#### What procedures can generate aerosols and droplets? ####

Many routine laboratory procedures can potentially generate aerosols and droplets that are often undetectable. The following laboratory procedures have been associated with the generation of infectious aerosols and droplets: centrifugation, pipetting, vortexing, mixing, shaking, sonicating, removing caps, decanting liquids, preparing smears, flaming slides, aliquoting and loading specimens, loading syringes, manipulating needles, syringes or sharps, aspirating and transferring blood and body fluids, subculturing blood culture bottles, spilling specimens, and cleaning up spills.
