title: Are there any vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat COVID-19?
---

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments.

The FDA is protecting consumers from [unapproved products and false or misleading claims](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products). Consumers and health care professionals can help by reporting suspected fraud to the FDAâ€™s [Health Fraud Program](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams) or the [Office of Criminal Investigations](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/criminal-investigations).
