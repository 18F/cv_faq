title: Is FEMA suspending rent for people in certain states?
---

FEMA [suspended rent](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/20200726/fema-announces-rent-suspension-disaster-survivors) for disaster survivors living in FEMA housing in California, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas through September 1. FEMA contacted eligible occupants to inform them of the rent suspension.

Other sources of financial relief for renters may be available through state and local governments. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development also provides information on [housing-related COVID-19 assistance](https://www.hud.gov/coronavirus).
