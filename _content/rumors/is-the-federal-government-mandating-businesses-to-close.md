No. The Federal Government recognizes that State, local, tribal, and territorial governments are ultimately in charge of implementing and executing response activities in communities under their jurisdiction, while the Federal Government is in a supporting role.

Accordingly, the CISA Essential Industry Guidance list is advisory in nature. It is not, nor should it be considered, a federal directive or standard in and of itself. 

While this guidance is not a federal mandate, and final decisions remain at the state and local levels, we firmly believe it can serve as a baseline for a common national approach in prioritizing essential services and workers.
