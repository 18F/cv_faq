title: Is the government sending everyone money?

A stimulus package has been passed by Congress to help Americans in need. As information becomes available, it will be updated on this site.

Unfortunately, scammers are using COVID-19 to take advantage of people. Donâ€™t trust anyone who tells you they can get you money now. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has more information about government scams, including [COVID-19 scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/coronavirus-scams-what-ftc-doing).
