title: I’m getting calls, texts, and emails from people claiming to be from the government.
  What should I do?
---

The Federal Trade Commission is [getting a lot of reports about fraudulent calls, texts, and emails](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/04/scammers-are-using-covid-19-messages-scam-people) coming from people pretending to be from the Social Security Administration, IRS, Census, USCIS and the FDIC. These fake government messages might say that you’re approved for money, can get quick relief payments, or get cash grants due to the coronavirus. These are all scams, and none of those messages come from a government agency. If you get a call or message like this, don’t respond. Instead, report it to the FTC at [ftc.gov/complaint](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&panel1-1).
