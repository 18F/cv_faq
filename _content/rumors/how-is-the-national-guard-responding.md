President Trump has directed the Secretary of Defense to permit full federal reimbursement by FEMA for statesâ€™ use of their National Guard forces. The [memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-governors-use-national-guard-respond-covid-19-facilitate-economic-recovery/) issued by the president provides governors continued command of their National Guard forces while being 100 percent federally funded under Title 32. This is in effect through August 21.

National Guard member responsibilities have included disinfecting public spaces, distributing food, assisting with transportation and logistical support of health officials and coordinating with state and local health and emergency managers. The use of the National Guard has enabled states to use the additional resources to meet the missions necessary in the whole-of-America COVID-19 response.
