title: Did FEMA block shipments of ventilators to my state?
---

FEMA did not block shipments of ventilators to any state. FEMA works with HHS and federal partners to coordinate distribution of medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE), from multiple sources including the Strategic National Stockpile, private industry donations, federal interagency allocation, and vendor procurements. These shipments are being sent with prioritization given to the areas with greatest need.
