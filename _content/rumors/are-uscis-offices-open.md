title: Are US Citizenship and Immigration Services offices open?

Beginning June 4, 2020, certain USCIS field offices and asylum offices will resume non-emergency face-to-face services to the public. Application support centers will resume services later. USCIS has enacted precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in reopened facilities:

Visitors may not enter a USCIS facility if they:

- Have any symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, fever or difficulty breathing;

- Have been in close contact with anyone known or suspected to have COVID-19 in the last 14 days; or

- Have been individually directed to self-quarantine or self-isolate by a health care provider or public health official within the last 14 days.

- Visitors may not enter the facility more than 15 minutes prior to their appointment (30 minutes for naturalization ceremonies), and sanitizer will be provided for visitors at entry points.

- Members of the public must wear facial coverings that cover both the mouth and nose when entering facilities. If they do not have one, USCIS may provide one or the visitor will be asked to reschedule their appointment.

- There will be markings and physical barriers in the facility; visitors should pay close attention to these signs to ensure they follow social distancing guidelines.

- Individuals may also have to answer health screening questions before entering a facility.

- Individuals are encouraged to bring their own black or blue ink pens.

Appointment notices will include further instructions for visiting USCIS facilities. For more information, see our [USCIS Visitor Policy](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-visitor-policy) and [USCIS Office Closings](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-office-closings) pages.
