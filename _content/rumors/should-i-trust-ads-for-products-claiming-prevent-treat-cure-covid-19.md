title: I've seen ads for products that say they can prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Some offer “treatments” in clinics or medical offices, including intravenous Vitamin C and D infusions, stem cell therapy, and immunity boosting shots. Should I trust these ads?

No. According to the FDA, there are currently no products or treatments available to the public that can prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. If you’re tempted to buy an unproven product or one with questionable claims, check with your doctor or other health care professional first.
