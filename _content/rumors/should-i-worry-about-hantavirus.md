title: Should I worry about hantavirus?

No. The main way hantavirus spreads to people is through infected mice and rats. It is possible to catch hantavirus from another person, but it’s extremely rare. For more information about hantavirus, [visit the CDC’s website](https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/).
