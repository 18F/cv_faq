title: I got a call from someone claiming to be a contact tracer. She asked for some health information and names of places and people I visited with recently. But she also asked for my Social Security number. I didn’t give it to her, and told her I needed to get off the phone. Did I do the right thing?

Yes. There’s no reason for a legit contact tracer to need your Social Security, bank account, or credit card number. To learn more, see: [Help COVID-19 contact tracers, not scammers](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/06/help-covid-19-contact-tracers-not-scammers).
