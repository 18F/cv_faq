title: Are US Citizenship and Immigration Services offices closed due to COVID-19?
---

On March 18, 2020 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services temporarily suspended in-person services at its field offices, asylum offices, and Application Support Centers (ASCs) to help slow the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). 

USCIS offices will reopen on May 3, 2020 unless the public closures are extended further. Employees in these offices are continuing to perform mission-essential services that do not require face-to-face contact with the public.

USCIS will continue to provide limited emergency services. 

Please call the [Contact Center](https://www.uscis.gov/contactcenter) for assistance with emergency services.
