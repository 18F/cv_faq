title: Is FEMA seizing medical supplies?
---

FEMA is not seizing or taking personal protective equipment (PPE) from state or local governments, hospitals, or anyone lawfully engaged in acquiring or distributing PPE.

If a hospital believes this has happened to them, it should be reported to the governor. If a governor believes that this has happened to their supplies, it should be reported to the FEMA Region. The situations below may also lead to incorrect assumptions of FEMA seizing or taking supplies:

- The Department of Justice (DOJ) has assembled a COVID-19 [Hoarding and Price Gouging task force](https://www.justice.gov/file/1262776/download) to identify cases of price gouging and may alert FEMA to some shipments and stockpiles of PPE. Under [Defense Production Act](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/03/20/use-defense-production-act-authorities-support-pandemic-response) authorities, FEMA may then compel a price gouger to sell PPE in its control to FEMA at prevailing market prices, not gouging prices.
- The perception that FEMA is "out-bidding" states and others for supplies is incorrect. Due the use of priority ratings in the Defense Production Act to reallocate critical resources, federal government requirements are put ahead of other orders so we can best assist areas most in need of supplies. As FEMA processes orders through the supply chain we maintain close coordination with states to identify potential bidding conflicts. If a bidding conflict occurs, we work closely with the state or tribe to resolve it in a way that best serves their needs.
- As part of the current agreement with distributors for [Project Airbridge](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/04/08/fema-covid-19-supply-chain-task-force-supply-chain-stabilization), 50 percent of the supplies on each international flight are directed by the distributors to customers in areas with the most critical needs for those supplies [based on HHS and CDC data](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/04/18/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-national-resource-prioritization-cell). If a company decides to cancel on a state contract in favor of a federal one, we work with the company and the state to resolve the matter in a way that best serves the people.
