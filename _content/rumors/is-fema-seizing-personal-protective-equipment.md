FEMA and Customs Border Patrol (CBP) are working together to prevent fraud when PPE and medical supplies enter the United States from overseas. PPE being distributed internally within the United States is not being seized or re-routed by FEMA. Reports of FEMA seizing or re-routing supplies are FALSE.

To report hoarding or price gouging of PPE report it immediately to the National Center for Disaster Fraud calling 866-720-5721 or [disaster@leo.gov](mailto:disaster@leo.gov).
