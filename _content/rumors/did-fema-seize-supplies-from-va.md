title: Did FEMA seize supplies from The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?
---

FEMA does not, has not and will not divert orders of PPE from our federal, state and local partners, nor do we have the legal authority to do so. To date FEMA has coordinated shipments of more than 4.3 million respirators, 1 million facial/surgical masks, 1.5 million gloves and 14,000 face shields to VA facilities across the country. FEMA and VA staff have worked closely together during this response, and they are co-located in the National Response Coordination Center. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the VA [issued a joint statement regarding these rumors](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/04/28/joint-statement-dhs-and-va-continued-collaboration-throughout-covid-19-pandemic) on April 28, 2020.
