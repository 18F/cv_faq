No. If you represent a small business or nonprofit, for information visit the [U.S. Small Business Administrationâ€™s COVID-19 loan resources page](https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources).

FEMA is not able to accept disaster assistance registrations for COVID-19. If you are unemployed due to COVID-19, please contact your local unemployment office.
