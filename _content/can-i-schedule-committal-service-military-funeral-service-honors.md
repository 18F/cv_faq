title: Can I schedule a committal service or a military funeral honors service?
---

Yes. Committal services are available at all national cemeteries. If holding a committal service, bear in mind that VA national cemeteries will continue adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the number of individuals attending committal services, practicing physical distancing between individuals not from the same household, ensuring all attendees and employees wear masks, encouraging frequent use of hand sanitizer and asking sick individuals to stay home. The number of permitted attendees will vary based on state and local guidelines.
