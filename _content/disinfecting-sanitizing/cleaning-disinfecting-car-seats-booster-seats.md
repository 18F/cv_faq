title: Do car seats and booster seats need extra cleaning and disinfection to prevent spread of COVID-19?
---

It may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this isn’t thought to be the main way the virus spreads. CDC recommends [cleaning and disinfection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html) of frequently touched surfaces and frequent handwashing or the use of hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as best practice measures for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses.

Some cleaning and [disinfection products](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19) are not recommended for use on car seats and booster seats. Owners should follow the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions for their car seats and booster seats.
[Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/child_passenger_safety/index.html) in the United States. Always buckle children in age- and size-appropriate car seats, booster seats, and seat belts when riding in a vehicle.
