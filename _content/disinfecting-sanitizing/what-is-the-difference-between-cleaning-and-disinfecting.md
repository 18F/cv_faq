title: What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting?
---

*Cleaning* with soap and water or a detergent removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection.  *Disinfecting* with a household disinfectant on [List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19) kills germs on the surface. By disinfecting or killing germs on a surface **after** cleaning the surface, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. For more information review cleaning and disinfection recommendations for [facilities](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html) and [homes](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html).
