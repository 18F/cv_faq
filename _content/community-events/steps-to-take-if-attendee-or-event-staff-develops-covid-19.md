title: What steps should I take if an attendee or staff person develops symptoms of
  COVID-19 while at my event?
---

If a staff member or attendee becomes sick at your event, separate them from others as soon as possible and until they can go home. Provide them with clean, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandDifferenceInfographic-508.pdf"> disposable facemasks</a> to wear, if available. If not available, provide them with a tissue or some other way to cover their coughs and sneezes. If needed, contact emergency services for those who need emergency care. Public transportation, shared rides, and taxis should be avoided for sick persons.

Be sure to contact local public health officials regarding the possible case of COVID-19 at your event and communicate with staff and attendees about possible exposure to the virus.
