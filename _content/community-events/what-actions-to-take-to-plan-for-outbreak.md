Creating an emergency plan for mass gatherings and large community events, such as concerts and sporting events, can help protect the health of your staff, attendees, and the local community. This planning should include:

* Encouraging staff and attendees to stay home if sick.
* Developing flexible refund policies for attendees.
* Providing supplies for attendees and staff that can be used to help prevent the spread of germs.
* Consulting local public health officials about your event.
