title: Will the government provide a second round of direct payments (checks) to people?
---

As of December 29, 2020, the Treasury Department will begin delivering a second round of Economic Impact Payments to millions of Americans as part of the implementation of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021.

Payments will begin on December 29 and continue throughout the coming weeks. Eligible individuals will receive an Economic Impact Payment of up to $600 for individuals or $1200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child. Generally, if you have adjusted gross income for 2019 up to $75,000 for individuals and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns and surviving spouses, you will receive the full amount of the second payment.  For filers with income above those amounts, the payment amount is reduced.

The payments will be distributed automatically, with no action required for eligible individuals. To check the status of your payment go to [IRS.gov/GetMyPayment](https://irs.gov/getmypayment).  For more information about Economic Impact Payments, please visit [IRS.gov/EIP](https://irs.gov/eip).
