The diagnostic panel's FDA-authorized [instructions for use](https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download) contain information about the test, its intended use, test procedure and performance characteristics. [FDA's EUA website](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations) has published the FDA [Letter of Authorization](https://www.fda.gov/media/134919/download) for the diagnostic panel, which defines the authorized use and the conditions of authorization that apply to CDC and to testing laboratories.
