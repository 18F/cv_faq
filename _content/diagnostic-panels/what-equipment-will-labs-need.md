The CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel also requires the use of additional authorized materials and authorized ancillary reagents that are not included with the test but are commonly used in clinical laboratories and are described in the authorized CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Instructions for Use Package Insert.

The CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel requires the following control materials, or other authorized control materials; all controls listed below must generate expected results for a test to be considered valid, as outlined in the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Instructions for Use:

* **Human Specimen Control (HSC):** A human cell culture preparation used as an extraction control and positive control for the RNase P primer and probe set that is extracted and tested concurrently with each specimen extraction run.
* **Positive Control for COVID-19 (nCoVPC):** Run with each batch of specimens.  Monitors for failures of rRT-PCR reagents and reaction conditions.
* **No Template Control (NTC):** Nuclease-free water included in each run.  Monitors for reagent and system contamination.
