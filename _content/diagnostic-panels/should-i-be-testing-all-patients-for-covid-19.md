Clinicians should base their decisions on whether a patient should be tested for COVID-19 on:

* Signs and symptoms,
* Local epidemiology, and
* If the patient has had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or a history of travel from an area with sustained transmission within 14 days of symptom onset.

Clinicians are encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness in addition to COVID-19. More details on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are found on [Evaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html).
