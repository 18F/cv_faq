The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on February 4, 2020.

* CDC's diagnostic panel is intended for use by laboratories designated by CDC as qualified, and in the United States, certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) to perform high complexity tests. This includes U.S. state and local public health laboratories and Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories. The test kits also will be shipped to qualified international laboratories, such as World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance Response System (GISRS) laboratories For more information, see the section labeled [CDC Laboratory Test Kit Distribution (general audiences)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/tool-virus-requests.html#test_distribute).
* Each laboratory that places an order will receive one diagnostic panel initially, and each panel can test 700-800 patient specimens.
