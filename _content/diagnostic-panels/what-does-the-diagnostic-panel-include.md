The CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel contains the following:

* 2019-nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2 and 2019-nCoV_N3 primers and probes that target the nucleocapsid (N) gene and are designed for both universal detection of SARS-like coronavirus as well as specific detection of the 2019-nCoV;
* RP primers and probes that target the Human RNase P gene; and
* nCoVPC, the 2019-nCoV positive control used in the assay.
