## What happens if there is a sick passenger on an international or domestic flight? ##

Under current federal regulations, pilots must report all illnesses and deaths to CDC before arriving to a US destination. According to CDC disease protocols, if a sick traveler is considered to be a public health risk, CDC works with local and state health departments and international public health agencies to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/contact-investigation.html"> contact passengers and crew</a> exposed to that sick traveler.

Be sure to give the airline your current contact information when booking your ticket so you can be notified if you are exposed to a sick traveler on a flight.
