Travelers from some countries with a level 3 travel health notice are being re-directed to certain airports and are screened for COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough or trouble breathing and asked questions about their travel and possible exposure to COVID-19. Travelers without symptoms will be told to stay home and practice social distancing.
