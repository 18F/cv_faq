At this time, travel restrictions and entry screening only apply to travelers arriving from countries with a level 3 travel health notice. [Note: US policies are subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.]

This means that if you traveled from countries other than those listed above, you:
* Won’t be subject to additional health screening upon arrival in the United States, and
* Won’t be under mandatory quarantine orders upon entry to the United States.

If you are arriving to the United States from a country with <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/"> level 2 travel health notice</a>, you will be asked to monitor your health and practice social distancing. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.

If you are coming from an international destination with a <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/"> level 3 Travel Health Notice</a>, you will be asked to stay home for 14 days from the time you return from travel, monitor your health and practice social distancing. Social distancing means staying out of crowded places, avoiding group gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.
