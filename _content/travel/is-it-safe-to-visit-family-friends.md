title: Is it safe to visit family and friends?
---

CDC recommends you [stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) as much as possible and [practice social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html). Traveling to visit friends and family increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. It is possible for someone to have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they have no symptoms. Getting infected may be especially dangerous if you or your loved ones are at [higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html). People at higher risk for complications need to take [extra precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html).

Although it can be hard to remain apart from loved ones during challenging or stressful times, try to connect with them in other ways, using video chats or phone calls.
