title: Can traveling to visit family or friends increase my chances of getting and spreading COVID-19?

Yes. Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Before you travel, learn if COVID-19 is spreading in your local area or in any of the places you are going. Traveling to visit family may be especially dangerous if you or your loved ones are [more likely to get very ill from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html). People at higher risk for severe illness need to take [extra precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html).
