At this time, American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and family members (as specified in the [Presidential Proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-certain-additional-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/)) who have been in countries with widespread ongoing transmission (Level 3 Travel Health Notice) within 14 days prior to their arrival will be allowed to enter the United States. Flights arriving from countries or regions with [widespread ongoing transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html#transmission) are being directed to certain airports in the United States. At these airports, travelers may be screened for COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough or trouble breathing, and they may be asked questions about their travel and possible exposure to COVID-19. Travelers without symptoms will be told to stay home, monitor their health, and practice social distancing. Travelers with symptoms will be directed to receive additional screening and health care.
