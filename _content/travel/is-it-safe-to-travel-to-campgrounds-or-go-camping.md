title: Is it safe to travel to campgrounds or go camping?
---

CDC recommends you [stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) as much as possible and avoid close contact, especially if you are at [higher risk of severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html). Going camping at a time when much of the United States is experiencing community spread of COVID-19 can pose a risk to you if you come in close contact with others or share public facilities at campsites or along the trails. This is because it is possible for someone to have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they have no symptoms. Exposure may be especially unsafe if you are at [higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html) and are planning to be in remote areas, far away from medical care.  Also be aware that many local, state, and national public parks have been temporarily closed due to COVID-19.
