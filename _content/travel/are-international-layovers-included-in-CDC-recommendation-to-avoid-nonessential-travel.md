Yes. Airport layovers in international destinations with a level 3 travel health notice are included in CDC’s recommendation to avoid nonessential travel. If a layover is unavoidable, CDC recommends you not leave the airport. Even if you don’t leave the airport during your layover, you may still be subject to screening and monitoring when entering the United States.

A layover is anytime you exit a plane when traveling to your final destination.
