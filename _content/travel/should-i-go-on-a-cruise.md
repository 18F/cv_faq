CDC recommends that all travelers [defer all cruise ship travel worldwide](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/covid-19-cruise-ship). Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.
