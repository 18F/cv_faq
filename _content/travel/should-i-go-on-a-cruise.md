CDC recommends all travelers, particularly older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/covid-19-cruise-ship"> defer all cruise ship travel worldwide</a>.

Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.
