CDC recommends all travelers, particularly older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions [defer all cruise ship travel worldwide](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship). Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.
