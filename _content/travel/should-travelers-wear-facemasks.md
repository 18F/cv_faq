title: Should travelers wear facemasks or coverings?
---

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that everyone wear a [cloth face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) over their nose and mouth when in the community setting, including during travel if they must travel. This as an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other [everyday preventive actions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html). A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical masks and N-95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
