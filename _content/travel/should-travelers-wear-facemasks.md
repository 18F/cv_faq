CDC does not recommend that healthy travelers wear facemasks to protect themselves from COVID-19. Wear a facemask only if you are sick and coughing or sneezing to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses to others. If you are well, it is more important to take these important steps to reduce your chances of getting sick:

* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. 
* To the extent possible, avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places – elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people, etc.
  * Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something.
  * Wash your hands after touching surfaces in public places.
* **Clean AND disinfect <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html"> frequently touched surfaces</a> daily.** This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
* If soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
