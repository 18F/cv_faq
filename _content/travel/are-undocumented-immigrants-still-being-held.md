To help prevent the introduction of Coronavirus into our border facilities and into our country, illegal aliens subject to the order will not be held by CBP, and instead will immediately be turned away from ports of entry.

Those encountered between ports of entry after illegally crossing the border similarly will not be held for processing and instead, will immediately be returned to their country of last transit.  

These aliens are processed in stations designed for short-term processing, where distancing is not a viable option, creating serious danger of an outbreak.
