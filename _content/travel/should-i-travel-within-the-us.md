title: Should I travel within the United States?
---

The COVID-19 outbreak in United States is a rapidly evolving situation. The status of the outbreak varies by location and state and local authorities are updating their guidance frequently. The [White House’s Opening Up America Again](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/) plan means some parts of the country may have different guidance than other areas. Check with the state or local authorities where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination to learn about local circumstances and any restrictions that may be in place.

### Travel recommendations
Cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in all states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19.

CDC recommends you [stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) as much as possible, especially if your trip is not essential, and [practice social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) especially if you are at [higher risk of severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html). Don’t travel if you are sick or travel with someone who is sick.

### Essential errands (within your local area)
As communities across the United States take steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting close contact, people are facing new challenges and questions about how to safely run essential errands to meet basic household needs, like:

- Grocery shopping
- Getting delivery or takeout food
- Banking
- Getting gasoline
- Going to the doctor or getting medicine

CDC provides advice about how to meet these [essential household needs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html) in a safe and healthy manner on another webpage; content on this page is about travel.

### Essential travel (outside your local area)
Some travel may also be essential, like:

- Travel to provide medical or home care to others
- Travel necessary for a job considered an essential service

The following travel recommendations provide advice about how to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 if you must travel. Don’t travel if you are sick or plan to travel with someone who is sick.

### Considerations if you _must_ travel
CDC recommends you [stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) as much as possible and avoid close contact, especially if you are at [higher risk of severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html). If you _must_ travel, there are several things you should consider before you go.

**Protect yourself and others during your trip:**

- Clean your hands often.
  - [Wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
  - If soap and water are not readily available, **use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol**. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub your hands together until they feel dry.
- **Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.**
- Avoid close contact with others.
  - Keep 6 feet of physical distance from others.
  - Avoiding close contact is especially important if you [are at higher risk of getting very sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html) from COVID-19.
- [Wear a cloth face covering in public](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html).
- Cover coughs and sneezes.
- Pick up food at drive-throughs, curbside restaurant service, or stores. Do not dine in restaurants if that is prohibited by state or local guidance.

Some types of travel (bus, plane, train) may require sitting next to others for a period of time. Travel may also expose you to new parts of the country with differing levels of community transmission. And, if you’re infected, your travel may put others at risk– along the way, at your destination, and when you return home.

If you _must_ travel, consider the following risks you might face, depending on what type of travel you are planning:

- **Air travel**: Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights. However, there may be a risk of getting COVID-19 on crowded flights if there are other travelers on board with COVID-19.
- **Bus or train travel**: Sitting or standing within 6 feet of others for a prolonged period of time can put you at risk of getting or spreading COVID-19.
- **Car travel**: The stops you need to make along the way could put you and others in the car with you in close contact with others who could be infected.
- **RV travel**: Traveling by RV means you may have to stop less often for food or bathrooms, but RV travelers typically have to stop at RV parks overnight and other public places to get gas and supplies. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others who could be infected.
