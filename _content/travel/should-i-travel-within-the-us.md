title: Should I travel within the United States?
---

The COVID-19 outbreak in United States is a rapidly evolving situation. The status of the outbreak varies by location and state and local authorities are updating their guidance frequently. The [White Houseâ€™s Opening Up America Again](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/) plan means some parts of the country may have different guidance than other areas. Check with the [state or local authorities](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination to learn about local circumstances and any restrictions that may be in place.

Depending on your unique circumstances, you may choose to delay or cancel your plans. If you do decide to travel, be sure to [take steps](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html) to help prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases during travel.
