At this time, travel restrictions and entry screening apply only to travelers arriving from some countries or regions with widespread ongoing spread of COVID-19. [Note: US policies are subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.]

If you are coming from a country or a region with [widespread ongoing transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html#transmission) of COVID-19 ([Level 3 Travel Heath Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)), you may be screened when you arrive in the United States. After you arrive home, take the following steps to protect yourself and others:

1. **Stay at home.** Do not go to work, school, or leave your house for 14 days. Discuss your work situation with your employer.
2. **Monitor your health.** Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever (temperature of 100.4°F/38°C or higher). Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.
3. **Practice social distancing within the home.** Avoid contact with other people for the 14 days. Maintain distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from family members and others in the home when possible.

If you are coming from a country with [ongoing community transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html#transmission) ([Level 2 Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/coronavirus-global)), take the following steps to protect yourself and others:

1. **Monitor your health.** Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever (temperature of 100.4°F/38°C or higher). Also watch for cough or trouble breathing.
2. **Practice social distancing.** Stay out of crowded places and avoid group gatherings. Do not go to shopping malls or to the movies. Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters). Do not take public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during this time.
