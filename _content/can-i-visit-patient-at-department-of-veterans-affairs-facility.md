title: Can I visit a patient at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility?
---

We're currently following CDC guidelines and limiting visitors for patients receiving care in a VA facility, including a medical center, clinic, nursing home, or Spinal Cord Injuries and Disorders System of Care. Limiting outside visitors helps us protect older Veterans and those who already have health issues. An adult visitor may be allowed to assist a Veteran, if needed, to get to or from an appointment or procedure in the facility. We encourage you to contact your facility prior to your appointment with questions regarding their visitation policy. Exceptions may be made by facility if a Veteran patient or their visitor needs assistance.

We know limiting visitors is difficult for families, but we’re taking these precautions to protect the most vulnerable patients from community spread of the coronavirus.
