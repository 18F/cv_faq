If you were around someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you to let you know that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

The best way to protect yourself and others is to [stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-options-to-reduce-quarantine.html). Check your [local health department’s website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/hd-search/index.html) for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period. Health department staff will help identify the dates for your self-quarantine. Health department staff can also provide resources for COVID-19 testing in your area.

- Self-quarantine means staying home away from others and monitoring your health.
- If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask. This will help protect the people around you.
- If you need support or assistance while in self-quarantine, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance.

Monitor your health and watch for [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). Remember, symptoms may appear 2-14 days after you were exposed to COVID-19. Tell the health department if you develop any symptoms. Tell people you were around recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, seek medical care. [Severe symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#seek-medical-attention) include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face.

The health department staff will not ask you for

- Money
- Social Security number
- Bank account information
- Salary information, or
- Credit card numbers
