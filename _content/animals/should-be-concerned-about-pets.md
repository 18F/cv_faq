excerpt: COVID-19 and animals
---

While this virus seems to have emerged from an animal source, it is now spreading from person to person. There is no reason to think that any animals &mdash; including pets in the United States &mdash; might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19. 

However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to wash your hands after being around animals. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals, including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/index.html" target="_blank">CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website</a>.
