title: Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?
---

Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice [healthy habits](https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/publications/stay-healthy-pets.html) around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.
