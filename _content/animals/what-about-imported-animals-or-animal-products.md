CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/index.html" target="_blank">CDC regulates</a> animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-and-animal-product-import-information/ct_animal_imports_home" target="_blank">USDA regulates</a> animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and <a href="https://www.fws.gov/le/businesses.html" target="_blank">FWS regulates</a> importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources.
