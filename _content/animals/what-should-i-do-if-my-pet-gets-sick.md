There is a very small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after having contact with a person with a COVID-19 infection. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.

If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, **do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself**. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other alternate plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.
