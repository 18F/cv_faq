The tiger infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 is the first case of its kind. We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a very small number of pets outside the United States, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19.

To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets, including cats, becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, can spread COVID-19 to people. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.

People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
