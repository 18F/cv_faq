No. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, "articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals" are drugs. The FDA has not approved any drugs for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of COVID-19 in animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) [Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB)](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/veterinary-biologics) regulates veterinary biologics, including vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other products of biological origin. Similarly, APHIS CVB has not licensed any products to treat or prevent COVID-19 in animals.

The FDA has taken action against fraudulent products intended to prevent or cure COVID-19. The public can help safeguard human and animal health by reporting any products claiming to do so to [FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov](mailto:FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov)or 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332).
