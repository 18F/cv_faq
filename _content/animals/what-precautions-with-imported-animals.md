Imported animals will need to meet [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/index.html) and [USDA](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/importexport/animal-import-and-export) requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.

This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
