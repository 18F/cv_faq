title: My pet has health problems and goes to the vet regularly for treatment. Should
  I be doing anything different to manage their health during the COVID-19 outbreak?

While you should not avoid necessary visits to your veterinarian due to the COVID-19 outbreak, you should exercise reasonable caution just like you would if you were going to any other public place. If you are concerned about your own health or that of your pet when going to the veterinarian, contact their office in advance to discuss any recommended precautions.
