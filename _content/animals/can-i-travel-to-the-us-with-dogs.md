Please refer to [CDCâ€™s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/index.html). The current [requirements for rabies vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/rabies-vaccine.html) apply to dogs imported from China, a high-risk country for rabies.
