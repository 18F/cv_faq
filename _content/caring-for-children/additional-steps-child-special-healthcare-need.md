title: My child has an underlying medical condition. What additional steps should my family take?
---

People of any age who have certain [underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. In addition to following the recommendations to [prevent getting sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/index.html), families can take steps recommended for children with underlying conditions.  

- Consider identifying potential alternative caregivers, in case you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers should not be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 themselves. For more information, see [Sick Parents and Caregivers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/parents-caregivers.html). Make sure these caregivers take extra precautions if [your child has a disability](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-disabilities.html). 

- If your child receives any support care services in the home, such as services from personal care attendants, direct support professionals, or therapists, make plans for what you will do if your child’s direct care providers or anyone in your family gets sick. You can review CDC’s recommendations for [Direct Service Providers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/direct-service-providers.html).  

For more information, see [Children and Teens](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/caring-for-children.html) and [Others who Need Extra Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations.html).
