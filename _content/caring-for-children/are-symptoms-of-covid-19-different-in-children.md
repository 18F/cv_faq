title: Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?
---

No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems.

CDC and partners are investigating cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. Learn more about [COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html).
