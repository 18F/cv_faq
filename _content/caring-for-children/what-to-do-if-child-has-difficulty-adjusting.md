title: What can I do if my child has difficulties adjusting to new routines and following
  recommendations?
---

Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and [wearing cloth masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html), can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.

- Keeping children at home and sheltering in place can lower stress created by social distancing and mask recommendations. Reach out to others for help in running essential errands.
- Behavioral techniques can be used to address behavioral challenges and to develop new routines. These include social stories, video modeling, picture schedules, and visual cues. Try rewarding your child in small ways with his or her favorite non-food treat or activities to help switch routines and to follow recommendations.
- Many of the organizations you turn to for information and support around your child’s complex, chronic medical condition may have information on their websites to help families address issues related to COVID-19.
- Your child’s therapist(s) and/or teachers may also have resources to help successfully introduce new routines to your child.
- While learning at home, continue special education services, accommodations, or services received in school through your child’s 504 plan or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP), as much as possible. Many schools are continuing interventions like speech therapy, small group classes, extended time and more.
