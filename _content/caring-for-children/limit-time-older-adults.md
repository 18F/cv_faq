title: Can my child spend time with older adults and people with chronic medical conditions?

[Older adults](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html) and people who have certain [underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fneed-extra-precautions%2Fgroups-at-higher-risk.html) are at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19.  

- If you live with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider separating your child from them if your child has frequent interactions with those outside the household (like at schools or other settings).  
- Consider postponing visits or trips to see grandparents, older family members, or family members with underlying medical conditions while there are high levels of transmission (or high number of COVID-19 cases) in your community.  
- If your child does visit someone who is older or has an underlying medical condition that puts them at risk of severe illness, your child should stay at least 6 feet away from that person. If your child is 2 years or older, he or she should also wear a mask. 
- Take steps to help [protect your child from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/protect-children.html) in order to reduce the risk of your child spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others especially people at increased risk of severe illness.
