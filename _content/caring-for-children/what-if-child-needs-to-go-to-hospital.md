title: What if my child needs to go to the hospital?

If your child’s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19:

- Ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share the important information the hospital will need to know to care for your child.
- Visiting policies may have changed due to COVID-19. If your child’s hospital policy does not allow an adult to stay with a child, ask your child’s healthcare provider for a statement explaining your child’s need for a familiar adult to be present.
- Bring your care plans/emergency notebook with you along with paper and pen to write down questions you have during your time at the hospital.
