Here are a few [things to check or consider](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/08/what-do-when-you-and-your-kids-are-online-home): Secure your router, update your software, and use strong passwords and two factor authentication (when available). Also, donâ€™t let your kids watch pirated content. Hackers are using illegal pirated content as a way in to your devices and wireless network.
