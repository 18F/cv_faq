title: Products online claim to prevent or treat COVID-19. Where can I report websites selling fraudulent products with fraudulent claims?
---

Currently, there are no FDA-approved products for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. The FDA advises consumers to be beware of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. If you have a question about a product sold online that claims to treat, prevent, or cure COVID-19, talk to your health care provider or doctor.

Please [report websites](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/email/oc/buyonline/english.cfm) selling products with fraudulent claims about treatment or prevention of COVID-19. If you have experienced a bad reaction to a product sold with COVID-19 claims, report it to the FDAâ€™s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program:

- Complete and submit the report [online](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/index.cfm); or
- Download and complete the [form (PDF)](https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download), then submit it via fax at 1-800-FDA-0178.
- Include as much information as you can about the product that caused the reaction, including the product name, the manufacturer, and the lot number (if available).
