Based on a review of the scientific evidence, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19. In light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects of these treatments in COVID-19 patients, the known and potential benefits no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for use.

The FDA revoked an emergency use authorization for use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate as a COVID-19 treatment on June 15, 2020 based on FDAâ€™s review of the scientific evidence.
