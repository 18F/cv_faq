title: Iâ€™m seeing ads for COVID-19 treatments and cures. Are these legitimate?

At this point, there are no vaccines or cures for COVID-19 available to the public, so you know that any claim to the contrary is false. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission has sent hundreds of [warning letters](https://www.ftc.gov/coronavirus/enforcement/warning-letters) to companies making false cure, treatment, or prevention claims. And more letters are on the way. If you see a product claiming to treat, cure, or prevent coronavirus, report it to the FTC at [ftc.gov/complaint](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&panel1-1).
