title: May health care providers prescribe chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine
  sulfate off-label to treat patients with COVID-19?
---

As mentioned above, chloroquine phosphate is only approved for the treatment of malaria, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate is only approved for the treatment of malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Once FDA has approved a drug, healthcare providers generally may prescribe or administer the drug for an unapproved use, including in clinical settings not described in the approved labeling. This decision will be based on their assessment of the potential benefits versus the risks for their patient, recognizing that FDA has not assessed the safety or effectiveness of such use.
