title: Does remdesivir benefit patients with COVID-19?
---

Preliminary data from a Phase 3 study conducted by the USG demonstrated that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received a placebo. A different Phase 3 study evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (most patients were not receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at baseline), found that a 5-day treatment course had a similar treatment effect as a 10-day treatment course. The safety and efficacy of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials.

In vitro (laboratory) testing of remdesivir also shows it is active against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Because remdesivir may help hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, FDA authorized its use under an [Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization) issued on May 1, 2020. Under the EUA, [health care providers](https://www.fda.gov/media/137566/download) and [patients](https://www.fda.gov/media/137565/download) are provided with information about the risks of remdesivir. However, additional evidence from clinical trials are necessary to determine whether the drug is safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.
