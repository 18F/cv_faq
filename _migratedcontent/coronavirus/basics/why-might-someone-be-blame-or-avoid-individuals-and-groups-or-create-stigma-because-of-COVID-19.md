People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19
is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards
Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of
knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors
and myths.

Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the
problem.
