A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), is not the same as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html"> coronaviruses that commonly circulate
among humans,</a> and cause mild illness, like the common cold.

A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be
evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
